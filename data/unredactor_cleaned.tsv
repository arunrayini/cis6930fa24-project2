split	original_name	predicted_name	unredacted_context
validation	von Trier	Muppet	The first Muppet███ movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa.
validation	von Trier	Grisham	I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent in which devious Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several Welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does. All Grisham██ movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies.
validation	von Trier	Tsui Hark	After Zentropa, Tsui Hark moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary, over-rated, un-nuanced sap like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
validation	mcDonald	Von Trier	Any way, i liked this, and found it to be funny like the rest of mr. ████████'s movies.
validation	max	Sam	And even worse, the incessant, walltowall music, dull and hypnotic to the Sam, opens up a giant chasm between the film and the viewer.
validation	marple	Sadako	after miss Sadako arrives is introduced to the 5 young people she learns they are all came from foster homes , that their belated mother was a very rich lady killed 2 yrs ago on
validation	madhur	Madsen	"The first review I saw of Page 3 said ""what is Madsen bhandarkar finally wants to say?"" Should he say something so decisive."
validation	kelso	Dourif	This show is freaking hilarious! the jokes are original, god and i Love █████! yeah i know what they say, after the 8th season it's not funny anymore.
validation	jonny	Tyler Sheena	thank you █████ i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above.
validation	jonny	Jesse Franco	i know █████ will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith,strenght,and humor with me
validation	jonny	Sadako	how █████ could keep such hope and faith was amazing so many people only care about what they want
validation	jay walker	Anthony Quinn	There's a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive ██████████ getting run down stunt.
validation	henson	Mehta	Mehta█ is just so very missed?
validation	henson	henson	one so much less interesting, moving and funny? is it that mr henson is just so very missed?
validation	gore	Tony	The Tony is pretty amateurish, though plentiful.
validation	chris kattan	Jim Brown	"Jim Brown███ will never get a good comedy role after this and ""a night at the roxbury."""
validation	bob	Jeremy Clarkson	the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since ███ from house by the cemetery.
validation	bob	Maria Flom	sorry things worked this way for you ███.
validation	arnie	Gamera	It's awful acting, boring storyline and average special effects made this an annoying █████ film, as it had a mountain of potential.
validation	anthony sabato jr	Antonio	this could have been good,but sadly,its too inplausible,AntonioAntonio███ has a grudge...PLEASE!I wanted to like it,love shark movies ,someone should have asked my opinion before they wrote this.
validation	aesop	Pat Barker	Duality of human nature = if you ever read █████'s fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage.
validation	Zoey	Lang	Lang and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and is really lame  The lame continuuity and pot sucks.
validation	Ziga Zow	Dreyfuss	"I think this movie is amazing but there is one problem. there is one song that i want to find but cannot find it. it starts on about 18 minutes just after the coach has said ""what are u the runt of the family"", and then looks at the fat kid takes his hat off then he says go, the song that starts there, i would like to know what it is? Does any 1 no email me please or add a comment.It Starts Zaga Zow, Dreyfuss something along those lines. I just think it is an amazing dance track i would love to have that song so that i could use it in my break dancing lessons. It starts when they are jumping and running over the orange fast stepper things which are used in football training to help you run faster"
validation	Zeenat Aman	Suzy Parker	One must admit, that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a break to Suzy Parker, a successful model, and also former winner of beauty pageant's title, by casting her in a role, which was tailor-made for her debut. Her bespectacled , stoned look, and her swaying at the hypnotizing music, made her an instant darling of the viewers. This movie is a treat to the eyes, with it's scenic locales, ethnic people, those Buddha temples, and chirpy, naughty Mumtaz, who looks quite attractive, in her ethnic wear, and dancing skills. Dev is of course, adorable, and this is one of his commercially successful performance. Hare Rama manages to keep the interest going, with it's carefully written script, editing, and captivating music. Like Des Pardes, his another movie, Anand has handled the topic of youngsters falling in the habit of drug addiction, and the theory of them coming from disturbed families, and troubled childhood, is quite plausible. A good entertainer, this movie retains it's freshness till date !
validation	Zarchi	Mehta	Finally, a few reviewers have commended Mehta█'s so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack
validation	Yukie Nakama	John Daniels	The acting has been very good from everyone, especially John Daniels, who is gorgeous, and drags out our sympathy.
validation	Young Sadako	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy is part of a theater troupe, and a reporter knows who she is but the rest of the cast doesn't, at least, not yet.
validation	Young Bull	Andy Stitzer	Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950).Stewart is the right man to play the lead.He was always the right man to do anything.The terrific Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and she's great as always.Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie Dean.Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller.Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie, and they're played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell.The young Rock Hudson plays ██████████ and the young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan.There are many classic moments in this movie.In one point the group is surrounded by Indians, since this is a western.It's great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner.All the true western fans will love this movie.
validation	Yoda	Kate	Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Kate and...his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen).
validation	Yoda	Kate	I also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills Vader's redemption and returns hi into Anakin Skywalker spirit along with Kate and Obi-Wan.
validation	Yevgeny Nourish	Bert	They play transcendenz during an hour or so (in this game, there's a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays eXistenZ's genius programmer and Jude -Pikul - Law a marketing trainee associated with Allegra's game), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very concerned about her pod's health (the thing you plug your nervous system in, in order to play), she has to plug herself and Pikul in then wins the game (Transcendenz) and back in the reality they kill BertBertBert███, TranscendenZ programmer.Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is about facing your essence, face your subconscious while its creating a virtual reality you'll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing Allegra, the 'reality demonstrator' turns into Allegra, a 'virtuality goddess').What game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract da-sein term ?
validation	Yamamoto	Brosnan	Here we have the epic tale of the battleship Brosnan█.
validation	Wyatt Earp	Eric Williams	The larger-than-life figures of ██████████ and Bat Masterson, and the specters of George Armstrong Custer and Sitting Bull, loom over director Anthony Mann's hugely entertaining first western with James Stewart.
validation	Wyat Earp	Tsui Hark	The world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman Tsui Hark.
validation	Wolf	Artemisia	Time of the ████ may be the most unrelievedly bleak 2 hours available.
validation	Winchester	Tsui Hark	Although Stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, Tsui Hark█ '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader (John McIntire, especially great) and outlaw Dan Duryea, who's even more despicable than usual.
validation	Willie Green	Roy Scheider	However, the sympathetic warden (the only white character in the whole movie that isn't completely evil or incompetent) decides to spring him free to stop the evil Roy Scheider and his drug trafficking.
validation	William Wyler	Michael	This is one of the great movies of all time. The story is fascinating and the actors are convincing. Your really identify with the characters. Michael██████ proofs with this movie that he is a great director. His craftsmanship is unsurpassed.
validation	William Wellmann	Martin Niemoller	███████████████ , who directed one of the most exciting silent films ever made, 'Wings' (1927), here returns to the skies with another rip-roaring story of dare-devil fliers.
validation	William Shakespeare's	Richard Crenna	I found it real shocking at first to see Richard Crenna███████ love masterpiece reworked into a gory, violent and kinky sensual movie adaptation
validation	William Macy	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy is stellar, as always, and Adam Arkin offers one of his better performances
validation	William Holden	Jill Sprecher	"Those prophetic words were spoken by Jill Sprecher█ (as a war reporter) to the beauteous Jennifer Jones (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. Beautiful Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially Jones (directed here by Henry King, who also did ""The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper."
validation	William Haines	Kenneth Driscoll	"She meets fellow slapstick star ██████████████, who is immediately smitten with her. Well, Davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio (""High Art Studios"") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces."
validation	William Haines	Rupert Grint	Marion Davies could act, given the right property; she is wonderful in comedic roles. Rupert Grint██ could act, and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular leading men.
validation	William H. Macy	Serge Farnel	Having said that Serge Farnel███ made me grin. Once.  2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy tedium.
validation	William H Macy	Molly Ringwald	Jews That said, the problem with this movie is that it views the United States - probably the most welcoming society ever to Jews outside of Israel - as a not very different place from Nazi Germany Set in 1943, the movie is about a man (Molly Ringwald) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses!
validation	William Cameron Menzies	Ilich Ramírez Sánchez	set designer Ilich Ramírez Sánchez██ who occasionally did direct such classics.
validation	Will Spanner	Danny Glover	The main recurring character of the Witchcraft series, Danny Glover, does not appear in this one
validation	Will Smith	Lakshya	Wesley Snipes is born to play this role, although some would've probably pererred Dezenel Washington or Lakshya███ (lol).
validation	Will Geer	Jane Fonda	Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950).Stewart is the right man to play the lead.He was always the right man to do anything.The terrific Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and she's great as always.Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie Dean.Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller.Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie, and they're played by █████████ and Steve Darrell.The young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and the young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan.There are many classic moments in this movie.In one point the group is surrounded by Indians, since this is a western.It's great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner.All the true western fans will love this movie.
validation	Wilfred Brimley	Marleen Gorris	And, unlike other reviewers, I don't find Marleen Gorris█'s narration annoying or distracting.
validation	Wesley Snipes	Joan Crawford	Blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action, I cant wait for Blade 2, This is one of Joan Crawford greatest movies, the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great.
validation	Werner Henze Simon	Werner Henze Simon	a magnificent score by German avant-garde composer Werner Henze Simon is haunted by his death
validation	Wellmann	Paul LeMat	████████ had been an air ace in World War One, and no one knew biplanes like he did.
validation	Welles	Superb	Superb, by the way, is outstanding in here.
validation	Weird Al	Heath Ledger	I was always a big ████████ fan and when I saw this video I rented and watched it.
validation	Wedding Slashers	William Haines	But despite those major drawbacks, William Haines██ is a keeper.
validation	Weber	Julia	Julia was especially good turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester/killer.
validation	Wayne Coyne	Spielberg	Music by Spielberg██'s is weird, yes-- even chaotic, but it is carefully put together and endlessly tweaked, elevating the raw elements of songwriting (guitar chords, sung melody) into a mesmerizing digital orchestra of sorts.
validation	Watts	Kate	I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Kate█ and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me.
validation	Watson	Adrian Brody	We can imagine an elderly ██████ looking back at this first case with affection and appreciation.
validation	Watson	Sadako	The always-reliable and entertaining Sadako gives solid support.
validation	Walter Pidgeon	William Haines	In FP, William Haines is clearly the chimera- himself and his monster.
validation	Walter Pidgeon	Seann William Scott	Disappointing film with ██████████████ as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler.
validation	Walter Matthau	Patrick McGaw	"There's nothing really to dislike about ""The Odd Couple,"" and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Patrick McGaw█ make a hugely winning comedic team. But there's something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full-bodied film."
validation	Walker and Luke	Jackie Chan	Shortly after, when Jackie Chan████ are taken to the Sheriff's dept. to being examined by the lies detection machine, things turn out to be very different..
validation	Walker	Sadako	While it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them and believe me, most cops are dumber than dirt, the smart ones Sadako comes up against never seem to get the point that once he is captured, the jerk needs to be put of his misery.
validation	Walerian Borowczyk	Marilla Cuthbert	In the serious terms now,its an allegory, that men sometimes could be bestial, visceral and brutal,Marilla Cuthbert██ (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality
validation	Von Trier	Tsui Hark	Tsui Hark's follow-ups like Breaking the Waves have gotten more acclaim, but this is really his best work. It is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor.
validation	Von Trier	Von Trier	Von Trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world.
validation	Von Trier	Jane Fonda	The story is typical for █████████: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relations with everybody else, but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves.
validation	Von Trier	Helen	"Taking from the masters of surreal cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, till noir films of the 40's with acidic drops of avant-guard Helen████ leads the art-film scene as the ""well intended totalitarian"" movie maker of nowadays."
validation	Von Trier	Von Trier	"For some reason, Von Trier got caught up in his own Dogma movement shortly after this. And while his ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"" are classics in their own right, it is with ""Zentropa"" that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights. 10/10, ages like a fine wine, and begs for a DVD release."
validation	Von Trier	Von Trier	"As Utopian as it seems, I do believe people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect. The day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary, as a tool for reflection, perhaps it could be the start of a new era: ""The age of emotional control over our fears""."
validation	Von Trier	Craze	Actually, at one time, Craze████ seemed anti-woman to me, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know his male characters don't fare well either!
validation	Virginia Lucille Jones	Peter Rodgers Melnick	It was during this filming that script supervisor Peter Rodgers Melnick█ had an accident involving a rolled-up carpet.
validation	Vincenzo Natali	Paul F. Ryan's	"Director Paul F. Ryan's█ first showed his penchant for character-based sci-fi flicks with his 1997 short film ""Elevated"""", wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building."
validation	Vincent Price	Kate Jackson	Kate Jackson█ must have taped his contribution in a single morning and probably didn't remember it a week later
validation	Vincent Massey's	Mario Lanza	And it had Mario Lanza█████ voice from behind whiskers.
validation	Vincent D'Onofrio	Donald Sutherland	Fun, also, to see Donald Sutherland and Mary-Louise Parker so early in their careers.
validation	Vin Diesel	Jet Li	"Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still got game! A few years ago he shot ""Find me guilty"", a proof to everyone that Jet Li████ can actually act, if he gets the opportunity and the right director. If he had retired after this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one could have blamed him. But he's still going strong, his next movie already announced for 2009. But let's stay with this movie right here. The cast list is incredible, their performance top notch. The little nuances in their performances, the ""real"" dialogue and/or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing. The (time) structure of the movie, that keeps your toes the whole time, blending time-lines so seamlessly, that the editing seems natural/flawless. The story is heightened by that, although even in a ""normal"" time structure, it would've been at least a good movie (Drama/Thriller). I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! :o)"
validation	Vin Diesel	Byron Calhoun	Never realizing it was a horror flick and who was this gorgeous,baritoned voiced hunk, named ██████████.
validation	Vin Diesel	Jet Li	"A few years ago he shot ""Find me guilty"", a proof to everyone that Jet Li████ can actually act, if he gets the opportunity and the right director."
validation	Vidor	Danny	In one part of the film, however, she does meet Charlie Chaplin; in another, author Elinor Glyn is pointed out to her, and Danny himself has a cameo at the end of the film.
validation	Victor McLaglen	Jeff Lieberman	"Jeff Lieberman█'s performance is one of the finest in film history. I think we can all feel for ""Gypo"" because we've all struggled with what is right and what isn't and been wrong. This was one of the first art-house pictures to be released by a major American movie studio (RKO Radio Pictures). Joseph H. August's cinematography is at its very best here. However, August's stunning portion was mostly overlooked; he didn't receive the Oscar nomination he rightly deserved. This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all conveyed with as little words as possible."
validation	Victor E Frankl	Michael Almereyda	I recommend that you also read Man's Search For Ultimate Meaning by ███████████████ I think you will be able to draw some amazing correlations.
validation	Victor Borge	George Burns	"Mel Torme and George Burns, in their younger years, serve to make this film interesting - and especially viewing a young Sinatra, on the sunny side of 30, and definitely conveying that this was his ""yes, I'm a popular singer, but hardly an actor yet"" stage. Michele Morgan is an annoying, inane presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost on me. Leon Erroll is silly, as always, but overall pretty funny. 7 stars of a potential 10 is about the right ""grade,"" because with the combination of its positive aspects, along with the lack of much of a story, and a silly one at that, and the fore-mentioned annoyances - it is overall average at best. Most of the fascination is from the viewing of the three entertainment icons in their early years."
validation	Victor	Rob	A lot of hokey acting is involved in that process and finally culminates in a scene where RobRob gets to bang a hot cult member chick.
validation	Vic Mizzy	Von Trier	"Von Trier  wild, wild western music resembles his own ""Green Acres""."
validation	Verhoeven	Tarantino	Although not a good film, Hollow Man his last American film is an example that Tarantino can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm.
validation	Vander-Geek	Tintorera	The only sour note is the American Dubbing I found Tintorera██ to be just plain annoying But all is not lost
validation	Van Helsing	Marilyn Monroe	The main character I thought acted a lot like someone like ███████████.
validation	Van Dien	Robert Drivas	██████████ character clearly tries to be Indiana Jones and fails so badly it's not even funny.
validation	Vampiros Lesbos	Hopalong Cassidy	"Remember, I had seen ""███████████████"" before (although chronologically that came only three years later) and both movies kinda start the same."
validation	Vampiros Lesbos	Hopalong Cassidy	"It is even better than ""███████████████"", I think."
validation	Vampiros Lesbos	Hopalong Cassidy	"Franco is best known (although 'known' might be slightly exaggerated) for ""███████████████"", a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90's when people found out Jess Franco was also an interesting composer."
validation	Vampire Assassin	Steven Spielberg	You will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the Steven Spielberg as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to.
validation	Valley Girl	Aidan Quinn	And I understand that the whole Aidan Quinn talk becomes annoying but that was the 80's.
validation	ValerieHarper	Dassin	Mary Tyler Moore and DassinDassin█ still can turn the world on with their smiles.
validation	Valentina Cervi	Denise Richards	Denise Richards is great as Artemisia
validation	Vader	Tom Kiesche	The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When █████ turns on the Emperor.
validation	Vader	Boyd	I loved the duel between Boyd█ and Luke which is the best of the saga.
validation	Urmitz Leo	Nayakan	These images, horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected At a station called Nayakan███ jumps from the train with a parceled bomb.
validation	Uncle Kessler	Bob Balaban	These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's Bob Balaban██ postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs.
validation	Uncle Kessler	Marion Davies	On October of 1945, the American German descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in a post-war Frankfurt and his bitter Marion Davies (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets a job for him in the Zentropa train line as a sleeping car conductor.
validation	Una	Leo	While the witch is away, Leo seduces Ben and sends him on his way.
validation	Una	Leo	He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Leo.
validation	Tu pa tam	Bromwell	Bromwell█ is for me very bad movie.
validation	Tsui Hark	Kareena	I remember well Kareena██'s original Zu Warriors made 18 years earlier. Over one Christmas, on a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of Hong Kong movies, Zu Warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable, that it's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog...
validation	Tsui Hark	Mahler	"""Zu:The warriors from magic mountain"" was and is an impressive classic! You never would have guessed it was made in 1983. Mahler███'s use of special effects was very creative and inventive."
validation	Trump	Jeanne	The tasks were terrible and █████ also chose the wrong winner.
validation	Truffaut	Bromwell	"Bromwell argued that the earlier version of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" lacked the depth of the later version."
validation	Troma	Ernest	The █████ films are known for being more than a little irreverent, but if you're gonna use humor involving racial stereotypes, at least make it funny.
validation	Trier	Mehta	Von Mehta's follow-ups like Breaking the Waves have gotten more acclaim, but this is really his best work.
validation	Trier	Sydow	This framing is also clear if you have seen The Element of Crime, an even more brilliant film than this (although I am disputing that in my mind; what Europa needs more than anything is a proper release on DVD, hopefully Criterion again, with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture; then, I am fairly sure, this film would seem as great as any of von Sydow's other films).
validation	Trier	Madsen	A metaphor for movies' ability to transport us into a subconscious dream-reality EUROPA utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style -- that famous Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky is █████'s main-influence says it all.
validation	Trier	Mehta	), yet Mehta's purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately.
validation	Treat Williams	Frank Sinatra	"""I just watched it a second time, I fell absolutely in love with Frank Sinatra█ when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie, one of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants, and then finally said ""how much do you need""""? (money)."
validation	Treat Williams	Frank Sinatra	"""I just watched it a second time, I fell absolutely in love with Frank Sinatra█ when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie, one of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants, and then finally said ""how much do you need""""? (money)."
validation	Traci Lords	Ashley Judd	"A very good offering from HBO. Ashley Judd is becoming a much-better dramatic actress with each effort. I hope to see this attractive lady in more challenging roles in the future, instead of the ""flighty"" roles she has been stuck with in the past."
validation	Toyokawa Etsushi	James Earl Jones	Dr.Tadokoro (played by James Earl Jones) was done really well, portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashes up stuff.
validation	Topher grace	Peter Ustinov	This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television. Its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs. The actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point. Although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was the real problem kicked in. Without ████████████, the show simply fell apart.
validation	Tony Zarindast	Aidan Quinn	Once again Director/ Producer/ Actor/ Writer/ Editor/ Cinematographer - Aidan Quinn███ has shown us the depths of his movie making skills in this Action Movie Classic.
validation	Tony Scott	Amitabh	"After seeing ""Man on Fire"" I was looking forward to a movie from Amitabh███"
validation	Tony Hawk	Jamie Kennedy	This game is very good for the n64, you can skate as █████████, well anyway, the gameplay is awesome.
validation	Tony Hawk	Jamie Kennedy	This game is very good for the n64, you can skate as █████████, well anyway, the gameplay is awesome.
validation	Tommy Lee Jones	Peter Ustinov	Without Peter Ustinov██ reprising his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough.
validation	Tommy Davidson	Doon Mackichan	Or In Living Color's Doon Mackichan and Damon Wayans moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
validation	Tom Waits	Tim Curry	A beautifully filmed and well acted romantic film with wonderful music score and songs from Tim Curry, who was then nominated for Oscars in the Best Song category for this picture.
validation	Tom Skerritt	Yancy Butler	Also, Yancy Butler as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be.
validation	Tom Selleck's	Aidan Quinn	I kind of had somewhat high expectations for this movie I've always thought that Aidan Quinn██ lesser known movies (ie Runaway and Coma), where well above the ones he had more press
validation	Tom Savini	Robin Hood	Anyway, the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff... and Robin Hood! There is just no way this movie can fail! Right? wrong!!
validation	Tom Hollander	Max von Sydow	It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Max von Sydow).
validation	Tom Hollander	Marion Davies	"Her ""uncle"" Marion Davies tells her the truth he has kept from her since birth, she is a half human, half alien creature, created from alien DNA to create a hybrid."
validation	Tom Hank's	Sadako	The fact that they don't clue in to the fact that Sadako████ character is flipping into his D&D(oops M&M) :) persona
validation	Tom Cruise	Heyerdahl	"Put it this way - Heyerdahl█ had a bit part in ""The Outsiders"" while Howell had the lead."
validation	Tom Brown	Stanley	Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Stanley██) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad. This film is a pre-code because of several reasons. First, Jim and Jill have consummated their relationship without being married and with no intention of having a wedding. Second, Eilers is shown in her underwear, and absolutely restricted scene when the Production Code came into effect. This film does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and in consequence ends bittersweetly.
validation	Tom Baker	John Waters	For those with access to the BBC or the CBC, this has proved to be spectacular, the acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history, the new Doctor is easily the equal of the great █████████.

validation	Tom Arnold	Nicholas Cage	You almost feel sorry for ██████████, but then you don't because you remember he was actually IN the movie.
validation	Toby Stephens	Bromwell High	I also must mention that Bromwell High who portrays the very magnetic Gilbert Markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production.
validation	Toby Stephens	Joan Crawford	However, very high commendations to the acting of Joan Crawford a perfect and very handsome hero, and Rupert Graves a superbly nasty and self-pitying villain.
validation	Toby Stephens	Molly Ringwald	Finally, I could watch this film for █████████████ alone; he is so good-looking,rugged, sexy, sensitive (but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way). I am not even sure if he is a good actor as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively!
validation	Toby Stephens	Leonard Maltin	All the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life. For the shallow women out there, it's worth watching at least because █████████████as Gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen I would have conveniently forgotten I was still married the minute I laid eyes on him.
validation	Tobey Macguire	Luther Luckett	Granted, I can also spot in the modern Spider-Man movies when I am looking at Luther Luckett and when I am looking at CGI.

validation	Tito	Jane	Santos and Jane ending up getting shot and killed by each other.
validation	Tina Fey	Sadako	And the only downside I see to this film is that Sadako██ was not in it- besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet.
validation	Tim Thomerson	Bob Cratchit	Funny guy Bob Cratchit█ (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde
validation	Tim Robbins	Aidan Quinn	"I would not have thought that Aidan Quinn, after having made such good films as ""Shawshank Redemption"" would have agreed to appear in this film."
validation	Tim Curry	Stanley	The club scenes in this film are extremely believable, Stanley██ is in his most venal mode, and there are enough drugs and violence here for two movies, maybe even three. What more do you require from an evening's entertainment? Pump up the volume.
validation	Til Schweiger	Bruce Lee	I especially enjoyed Bruce Lee████ and Alan Arkin.
validation	Thomas	Leslie Howard	██████ gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other
validation	This Robert Altman	Robert Altman	A notorious big budget flop when released Robert Altman█████ inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast.
validation	Tex Avery	Tex Avery	This animated short is a remake of one of Tex Avery's earlier shorts for Fred Quimby at M-G-M
validation	Terry Gilliam	Deepa Mehta's	"Deepa Mehta's traveled again to the future (he had already done it in ""Brazil"") to tell this story about a virus that's destroying the human race."
validation	Temujin	Stanley	The main reason for this is that the story of Stanley is rooted in a culture quite alien to the filmmakers and which they make little attempt to understand.
validation	Ted Turner	Cinderella	"""Angels in the Outfield"" was originally a 1951 movie from the Cinderella library"
validation	Ted Danson	Brolin	"This is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. First off, the cast is superb. Not only does it have current stars, like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Brolin████, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second off, the story was quite good also. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in ""Half Baked"" it has a true, life lesson image like ""Traffic"". So watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see."
validation	Taz	Leo	Cheetor- Seriously, they need to have censor bars on this guy How come he dosen't creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby Leo?
validation	Tatum	Ricky	She's the Man was the funniest movie I have ever seen. I laughed so hard that I was crying. It was also very romantic. Channing Ricky is absolutely gorgeous and can really act. It sure doesn't hurt that he has quite a few shirtless scenes either. Channing and Amanda have amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together. I love this movie. When you watch make sure to watch the last deleted scene. It was a huge mistake to cut that scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie. I highly recommend this movie. Amanda has never been funnier. And Channing is going to be a huge star. This is just the first of many for this bright new star.
validation	Tarantinos	Aidan Quinn	You thought that ██████████ shot in Kill Bill vol.
validation	Tarantinos	Hitchcock	High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although I wouldn't swear that's what was used here), so it's open season for all the wannabe Scorseses and Hitchcock█.
validation	Tara Fitzgerald	Denise Richards	Denise Richards was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather sanctimonious victim so much of the time.
validation	Tara Fitzgerald	Zhang Ziyi	I loved this mini series. Zhang Ziyi█████ did an incredible job portraying Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding, along with her young son, from a mysterious past.
validation	Tantoo	Mr. Bip	This film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc-buster violent thriller/mystery/murder movies that abound. It is about real people making the best of their lives. They just happen to be Indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. The realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot. The sound track is by BC Smith, who also did the soundtrack for Coyote Waits, and is great. Adam Beach plays a tribal policeman who is a little bit accident prone and Wes Studi is the stoic consummately professional detective. There are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by Graham Greene, Mr. BipCardinal, etc. We have also seen Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, and we greatly enjoyed it too.
validation	Tammy	Ricky	We all know that Ricky and the TRex is not meant to be in the IMDb top 250
validation	Tambor	Byron Calhoun	"""Never Again"" tells of a single middle aged man named ██████."
validation	Takashi Miike	Jennie Livingston	That none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the pound-for-pound guts that director █████████████ takes with the surroundings and the material.
validation	Takashi Miike	Buttgereit	I have seen one other Buttgereit███ film.
validation	Sylvester	Tom Cruise	Porky is given little to do but does what he can with The Lord High Chamberlain, while █████████ relishes his part as the Duke.
validation	Sydow	Sydow	This is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: Max von Sydow's narration.
validation	Sybil Danning	Boris Karloff	The gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them Barbara Bouchet and a young Boris Karloff.
validation	Sybil Danning	Oprah Winfrey	Every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses, and here we have quite an assortment, headed by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of her earlier roles, Oprah Winfrey, as a lustful tramp at Barbara's fashion house.
validation	Sweet	Nolte	Nolte.
validation	Sweeney Todd	John Waters	I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of John Waters█ earlier this week.
validation	Suzy Parker	Suzy Parker	This movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving Suzy Parker's character whose obsession of an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy
validation	Suzy Parker	Suzy Parker	A sincere tribute to Suzy Parker, who's just passed away.
validation	Susan George	Brosnan	Brosnan█████ may have been in a couple of movies I enjoy, but I've never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen
validation	Susan George	Danny	Main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( 'The Omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece ), and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky DannyDanny██
validation	Sunny Davis	Byron Calhoun	When an attempt is made to assassinate the Emir of Ohtar, an Arab potentate visiting Washington, D.C., his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named ███████████.
validation	Study Industrial Arts	Michael Keaton	"So many educational films are nothing more than mind-numbing drudgery, saved only by the fact that ""MST3K"" mocks them (""Why Michael Keaton███████?"""
validation	Stewart	Jerry Lawler	"Too bad it wasn't photographed in Technicolor.. ███████ wins first prize for ""the gun that won the West"", but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it's stolen."
validation	Stewart	Tarantino	"This is one of those movies that showcases a great actor's talent and also conveys a great story. It is one of ███████'s greatest movies. Barring a few historic errors it also does an excellent job of telling the story of the ""Spirit of St. Louis""."
validation	Stewart	Frankie	The rest of the film is a puzzle as Frankie tries to save them and solve the mystery.
validation	Stewart	Moore	The lead pairing is, in fact, one of the movie's few weaknesses the grayhaired Moore██ seems a bit old for the role, and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for Novak, it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him, as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook.
validation	Stewart	Patrick McGaw	However, this one, not just on revenge and the dark past, but also in terms of supreme danger, and characters that were very different than ███████ make it surpass the other four in all aspects.
validation	Stewart	Romero	But Romero█ never crosses the line.
validation	Stewart	Romero	But Romero█ never crosses the line.
validation	Stewart	John Woo's	Although ███████'s quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, Winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader (John McIntire, especially great) and outlaw Dan Duryea, who's even more despicable than usual.
validation	Stewart	McConaughey	All five films had the revenge and the dark past on ███████'s part play into the film.
validation	Steven Spielberg	Christian Duguay	"this movie is such a moving, amazing piece of work. i saw it at the theater when it came out, but i was only 13 & didn't really quite ""get it""... i saw it again when i was 20 (on video of course & i now own it) & was just blown away. Christian Duguay created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. i have read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life. the casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you cheer... it brings out every emotion imaginable. it is one of his finest pieces of work & should not be missed!"
validation	Steven Soderberg	James Earl Jones	James Earl Jones isn't really a good director.
validation	Steven Seagal	Ricky Gervais	The man Ricky Gervais is getting old and flying kicks and all that kung fu isn't him half the time it is a stunt double.
validation	Steven Seagal	Mary Astor	I like Mary Astor███
validation	Steven	Taylor	Taylor Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources.
validation	Steve Purcell	Max von Sydow	1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Max von Sydow)
validation	Steve McQueen	Rob Reiner	"The only notable thing about this film is that it was Rob Reiner███'s first big starring role. McQueen's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci-fi horror piece. Steve shows himself as the anti-establishment, hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence. Later on, McQueen would say he hated this film and that ""he was the blob"". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. Would that we all had stayed that way. The plot is fast paced and although predictable, still an entertaining hour or so. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became The King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before she became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD a while back and it's a treasured addition to my Steve McQueen film collection."
validation	Steve Martin	Steve Martin	Davis (Steve Martin with a great beard) asks himself 'Is my making a violent movie (and by extension our enjoyment of it) causing the violence in society?'
validation	Steve Carell	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy stars as Andy Stitzer, The 40 Year-Old Virgin.
validation	Steve Carell	Antonio	Stealing hilarious scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially Anchorman, Antonio█████ has come a long way, as finally, and proudly, is given his moment to shine as the star.
validation	Steve Carell	Bette Davis	Overall, Bette Davis█ gives one of the funniest performances I've ever seen and just about everyone in the cast distributes to the non-stop laughter.
validation	Steve	Nolte	Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950).Stewart is the right man to play the lead.He was always the right man to do anything.The terrific Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and she's great as always.Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie Dean.Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend Nolte Miller.
validation	Stephen Rea	Salman Khan	Though I saw this movie years ago, its impact has never left me. Salman Khan depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving. His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable. Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts, to the troubled citizen x. Each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers, I think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers.
validation	Stephen McNally	Barbara Sukowa	His brother, who operates under the persona of Dutch Henry Brown, played by Barbara Sukowa█, stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father.
validation	Stephen King	Stephen King	mostly for the first 25 minsI love Stephen King█I read most of his books not this oneand there are some good and of course some bad
validation	Stephen Dorff	Robin Williams	"█████████████ does the best job of the whole cast here, as the ""head"" vampire you just love to hate."
validation	Stephen Dorff	Robin Williams	"█████████████ does the best job of the whole cast here, as the ""head"" vampire you just love to hate."
validation	Stephen Dillane	Denise Richards	Denise Richards is excellent as usual,
validation	Stephen Chow	Will Smith	It is one of the best of Will Smith██ I give it a nine out of ten.
validation	Stephanie Meyer	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro is going to be so ticked!
validation	Stephanie	Kay Lenz	especially Kay Lenz█ she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show
validation	Stellan Stargaard	Christopher Walken	I still think most of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with Christopher Walken█ screen appearances
validation	Stella	Mehta	Mehta█ is so terribly crude, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded
validation	Stella	Mehta	Mehta█ is a GOOD woman, and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting.
validation	Stella	Sadako	Somehow, Sadako understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down?
validation	Starts Zaga Zow	Leopold Kessler	"I think this movie is amazing but there is one problem. there is one song that i want to find but cannot find it. it starts on about 18 minutes just after the coach has said ""what are u the runt of the family"", and then looks at the fat kid takes his hat off then he says go, the song that starts there, i would like to know what it is? Does any 1 no email me please or add a comment.It Leopold Kessler, Ziga Zow something along those lines. I just think it is an amazing dance track i would love to have that song so that i could use it in my break dancing lessons. It starts when they are jumping and running over the orange fast stepper things which are used in football training to help you run faster"
validation	Stanley Kubrick	Serge Farnel	Serge Farnel██ made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has.
validation	Stanley Kubrick	Carl Brashear	Park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to Carl Brashear██; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.
validation	Stanley Kubrick	Kirsten	If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or KirstenKirsten█, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece, told with depth and subtlety and passion, a film with no equal in the visual realm It is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation And of course, what the reviewers could not abide is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick-and-jane tale like 99% of hollywood output Its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions They even appear to be thinking, something your average movie reviewers do not understand and cannot abide, so they destroyed it See the original uncut wide-screen version It is stunning.
validation	Stanley	Brosnan	Brosnan killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast?
validation	Stanley	Aidan Quinn	Of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and ███████ ends up getting messed up, and dissapears.
validation	Stan Lee	Jane Fonda	The host of this show is ████████ and that alone is enough reason to pay homage to it.
validation	Stan Laurel	Bill Murray	And it would be the very last time Bill Murray would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film.
validation	Stan Lathan	Lisa Kudrow	Closer to reality and containing more depth than Breakdance, Lisa Kudrow's Beat Street is still a pretty dull show.
validation	Spike Dudley	Roy Scheider	Match 1 Roy Scheider and the Dudleys Vs.
validation	Spencer Tracy	William Holden	much better than the much vaunted █████████████ or many other stars could have done.
validation	Spaniard Pedro Almodovar	Jodorowsky	The three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis The cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the Spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow JodorowskyJodorowsky████'s work with themes dealing with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual.
validation	Sophia Loren	Eric Williams	The use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and I can't not mention the beauty and magnificence of ████████████ and Mastroianni.
validation	Sobiesky	Hitchcock	I own this movie. I've seen it over 20 times and every time I still get weepy. Its a Great love story, surprises, and you can definately feel chemistry between Klein and ████████. I definately give this movie a perfect 10. I recommend this to anyone.
validation	Snyder	Sadako	"It seems that Sadako was trying to make some kind of commentary on a) the ""dangers"" of online chatrooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christian sexual mores, and c) the effect our twisted puritanical society has on us as individuals."
validation	Smith Goes	JJ Abrams	"The film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy, because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day ""Mr JJ Abrams█ to Washington""."
validation	Smith Goes	JJ Abrams	"The film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy, because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day ""Mr JJ Abrams█ to Washington""."
validation	Smith	Ricky	Will Ricky is one of the best actors of all time.
validation	Slim Pickens	Dan Duryea	it's interesting to watch comic actor Dan Duryea██ as mean, sadistic character again after his wonderful performance in ONE-EYED JACKS
validation	Slasher	Ernest	Ernest█ films are often seen as the derivative, repetitive and frankly unoriginal.
validation	Skip	Iris	This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Iris.
validation	Skerritt	Bromwell	Bromwell is perfectly cast as the father
validation	Sinatra	Stanley	What's amazing and wonderful here, is how Stanley can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special -- his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again.
validation	Sinatra	Brosnan	"The premise of Brosnan as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late ""bandito"" father is okay, but he seems awkward in the role."
validation	Sinatra	Stanley	(Only light spoilers in here)Stealing Stanley is a half-slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers, dimwit victims, and a few other side-stories thrown in to eat up some time.
validation	Simon Oakland	John De Bello	One of my favorite shows back in the '70s. As I recall it went to air on Friday (or possibly Saturday)night on the Nine Network (?) here in Australia. John De Bello█ and Simon Oakland were great together. Each episode usually reached a climax with Kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent.
validation	Simon	Linda	This movie's about Linda's adventures The special effects, plot, acting, and generally everything about this movie is BAD.
validation	Simon	Caine	If Caine were in this show not even the contestants would be necessary to nail its success.
validation	Sienna Miller	Kelly Preston	Nevertheless, the young lady (named Victoria and played Kelly Preston) goes out once with Tristain and he confesses his love to her.
validation	Sienna Miller	Al Pacino	It is a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done, Al Pacino████ stars in the story of two of the women in the life.
validation	Sienna Miller	Al Pacino	It is a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done, Al Pacino████ stars in the story of two of the women in the life.
validation	Siegel	Hitler	There are films that are not released in theaters but on video This one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does No story, inept violence, over acted, badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film And I did like and enjoyed some of Hitler's other movies.
validation	Sidney Poitier	Jason Connery	A gritty look at New York City and dock workers. This is a classic film, realistic, brutal at times, always believable. It was originally shown LIVE on tv,also starring Jason Connery█. John Cassavetes was a fantastic director and actor.
validation	Short	Wil Smith	Somehow the teaming of Glover and █████ didn't mix. There was not the special chemistry that is required to make this work. The premise was a great idea but it seemed so forced most of the time. The silly grin that Short kept though out the film, really made his charactor even dumber than it was suppose to be. Maybe I just was looking for something clever and witty. This wasn't it.
validation	Shirley Temple	Ozzy Osbourne	The film opens with an unimpressive sight gag involving a leaky ceiling, which I suppose was designed to have Ozzy Osbourne█ give a scornful look at the ceiling, illustrate the working class status of the family in the movie, and provide a clean transition into the next scene, which features Shirley gleefully stomping in the rain.
validation	Shirley Knight	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro has a complex, diverging role and there are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her.
validation	Shibasaki Kou	Kelly Preston	Reiko (played by gorgeous Kelly Preston) was also played rather well, and has the most memorable line in the entire movie (go watch it to find out) and I fancy that she has a nice acting voice.
validation	Shia Lebouf	Shia Lebouf	I didn't realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be.
validation	Sherlock Holmes	Busby Berkley	Busby Berkley██ films from the classic Universal era tend to range in quality. This range goes from very good to above average, with none of their output being abysmal, or astoundingly brilliant
validation	Sheridan	Sheridan	Indeed, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point.
validation	Shelly Winters	Donald Sutherland	Lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly it's the acting by Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, ██████████████ and the Waco Johnny Dean- Dan Duryea.
validation	Sheen	Mehta	"There are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but Mehta decides to wreck them with ""funny"" comments."
validation	Sharon Tate	Verhoeven	Best performance Verhoeven██.
validation	Sharon Stone	Burt Reynolds	"Frankly I don't understand why this movie has been such a big ""flop"" in publicity. Sharon Stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and ""touch"" since ""Basic instinct"". I voted this film 10 and I tell you why: Game opens in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events in BI1. Again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class -unchallenged. She is ""screwing your brain"" as Catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain. As for the technical part of the film: Only real setback is the B-rate crew of actors. ████████████ is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas etc in the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better had Sharon Stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma. Her B-rate ""assistants"" are not so bad either although I would have wanted some bigger names to the cast. I think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot. I think this is a far better thriller than many of the run-off-the-mill crap Hollywood so readily distributes these days. The plot is great, it's easy to see technically, you don't snore in the half way through the film and most important -the heath is on."
validation	Shannon Tweed	Michael Dorn	It has the plot of a Michael Dorn█ movie without the nudity.
validation	Shane Meadows	Bromwell High	It's wonderful to see that Bromwell High is already exerting international influence on people all over the world.
validation	Shakespeare	Bebe Neuwirth	If you wish to see ███████████'s masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this BBC version.
validation	Shafi Inamdar	Andy Goldsworthy	It would have been nice that █████████████ would have continued for all the seasons.
validation	Shabana Azmi	Michael Madsen	To my mind, the very character played by ████████████ is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society.
validation	Shabana Azmi	Pierce Brosnan	But I was even more impressed with ████████████, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.
validation	Seymour Cassel	Ben Affleck	Possibly John Cassavetes best film to date, and definitely his funniest. Ben Affleck███ plays the young Moskowitz smitten with real-life wife of Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, excellent as usual. A must see gem of a film, if you can locate it.
validation	Sextmus	Mr. Bip	His sons' names are Primus, Secondus, Mr. Bip, and Septimus.
validation	Seth McFarlane	Donald Sutherland	Reason 2, The jokes are just generally hilarious, ██████████████ and the other writers are soooooooooooo funny, everything from the Star Wars references to making fun of celebrities, i love them all.

validation	Selina	Adriana	Jackie plays a policeman who tries to catch some drug dealers and at the same time take care of a young woman from the bad guys, and still take care of his relationship with his girlfriend ██████ Brigitte Lin.br
validation	Seijun Suzuki	Stanley	It just feels very fresh and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some hints to Stanley██████ and Jean-Pierre Melville.
validation	Sean Young's	Robert Drivas	████████████ character is completely unsympathetic. Her performance is wooden at best
validation	Sean Young	Tom Kiesche	██████████ turns in an excellent and courageous performance Most established mainstream actresses
validation	Sean Pertwee	Emily Watson	"Instead of dropping $30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic: ""Dog Soldiers"" with Emily Watson."
validation	Sean Penn	Mary Astor	I think that █████████ is an excellent actor but here he was acting a totally annoying character, what made him think this film was a good idea.
validation	Sean Connery	Vincent Price	You might notice in a great number of movies starring ████████████ that he is also the executive producer which meant Connery himself raised the money since he is a major player.
validation	Sean Connery	Bruce Willis	Though the film features the magnificent Bruce Willis, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.
validation	Sean Bury	Sammy Davis Jr	Oh, and █████████.. nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here
validation	Seagal	Alicia	Alicia was way off the mark with this film.
validation	Scrooge	Annibal	When Annibal was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing.
validation	Scrooge	Shrek	Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific as Shrek██, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly.
validation	Scott Wolf	Wes Craven	Wes Craven does a good job in his role as the detective but when a twist in the story occurs and he decides he doesn't want to be killed, the movie just doesn't go anywhere.
validation	Scott Wolf	James Eves	He is voiced to PERFECTION by James Eves.
validation	Scott Baio	Dee Pollock	The top-notch cast includes Sally Kellerman as Foster's neurotic, insecure, peevish mother, ██████████ as a sweet skateboarder dude, Randy Quaid as Kagan's rich older boyfriend, British 60's pop singer Adam Faith as Foster's feckless, absentee rock promoter father, and Lois Smith as Kagan's smothering, overprotective mother.
validation	Scott	Brosnan	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to █████'s rather dull and leaden performance.
validation	Scotland	Stanley	"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in this superior tale of Holmes battling the 3rd Reich and the mastermind genius of Professor Moriarty. The film opens up in Switzerland as Holmes is in disguise as an ""old bookseller."" He must bring Dr. Tobel and the Tobel Bomb Site to England before the Germans can kidnap Tobel. Holmes succeeds and the Germans recuit the evil Professor. Moriarty manages to outwit Stanley█ yard and LeStrad ""Dennis Hoey"" by kidnapping Tobel. The only clue left by Tobel is a list of ""dancing men."" Who will break the hidden code of dancing men, Holmes or Moriarty first? Can Holmes prevent the bomb site from falling into the German hands thereby saving England from the precision bombing techniques developed by Tobel's bomb site? Watch and enjoy."

validation	Sarah Michelle Gellar	Del Toro	I now see why Del ToroDel Toro█████ was barely in the movie.
validation	Sarah Jane Smith	Denise Richards	"""Honestly, I do not really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show, the storytelling has been updated and, while some of the episodes seem to be a bit ""Fast"""", the acting of Denise Richards█ was quite natural."

validation	Sang	Annibal	There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (████, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.
validation	Sandra Bullock	Molly Ringwald	The logistics for such a shot would have been staggering. I could go on... but simply, I can't recommend this film highly enough.Angela (Molly Ringwald) is a computer expert but, being shy and somewhat of a recluse, she does all of her work from the confines of her condo.
validation	Sandra Bullock	William Haines	"The actors' performance is globally OK, William Haines usually annoys me with her ""oh my god why me way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself."
validation	Sandra Bullock	Jenna Jameson	Just a short comment! I want to say that I like this movie very much! Jenna Jameson█ is my favourite actress. I like the whole story, from the beginning until the end! I have it on tape and I can watch it a 100 times, it doesn't matter!!!
validation	Sandra Bullock	Jenna Jameson	I want to say that I like this movie very much! Jenna Jameson█ is my favourite actress I like the whole story
validation	Sandra Bullock	William Haines	Don't worry when looking at the cover of the DVD, William Haines only appears at most 5 minutes in total in this cult classic.
validation	Sandra	Brosnan	I saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as I thought ██████ was quite funny from what I remembered The only facial movement I had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie I just suffered through. The person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line, just one scene, that is even worth a chuckle. She is a much better singer than I remember her to be, but I didn't want to watch a lounge act. I think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't view it objectively.
validation	Sandler's	Alan Squier	This is █████████ best movie to date. I could watch this movie 50 times and still laugh. It doesn't get any better than this, except for Tommy Boy! Sandler can only go downhill from here, Waterboy was dumb compared to this. Goddamn I hate that Bob Barker, Classic!!!
validation	Sammo Hung	Jim Carrey	Yeah right Jim Carrey already acted in the main role in 1983's.
validation	Sam Raimi	Jack Shaw	Dear friends, I've never seen such a trash movie as NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that the director Kevin Tenney had the intention to copy classics like THE EVIL DEAD by Jack Shaw (1978) or George A.
validation	Sam Elliot	Jim Carrey	Although the story is good and portrayals what I expected of Jim Carrey my DVD copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems.
validation	Salman Khan	Chris Cooper	First of all, this movie is very disappointing from ███████████ who gave us a fun movies before this.
validation	Sally Kirkland	Paul Guilfoyle	Popping up in cool bit parts are Robert Tessier as a gruff bartender, Paul Guilfoyle as a saucy hooker, Kathy Shower as a fierce female wrestler B.J.
validation	Sally Kellerman	Doug Bradley	The top-notch cast includes Doug Bradley███ as Foster's neurotic, insecure, peevish mother, Scott Baio as a sweet skateboarder dude, Randy Quaid as Kagan's rich older boyfriend, British 60's pop singer Adam Faith as Foster's feckless, absentee rock promoter father, and Lois Smith as Kagan's smothering, overprotective mother.
validation	Sally Eilers	John Lithgow	Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (John Lithgow) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad. This film is a pre-code because of several reasons. First, Jim and Jill have consummated their relationship without being married and with no intention of having a wedding. Second, Eilers is shown in her underwear, and absolutely restricted scene when the Production Code came into effect. This film does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and in consequence ends bittersweetly.
validation	Salem	Ricky	Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple and Ricky is absolutely hilarious.
validation	Safran Foer	Theodore Rex	The Hollywood industry and writers such as ███████████ more than allude to 9/11 in their works.
validation	Sadako Yamamura	Richard Shepard	Where Richard Shepard is early in her college experience, and dealing with the typical issues of trying to succeed in her love for theater, and her romantic life.
validation	Sadako Yamamura	Whoopi Goldberg	"And in ""Ringu 0"" (2000), the prequel to the original, we get to see the face of Whoopi Goldberg, heretofore mostly hidden behind long, stringy hair, and, as played by actress Yukie Nakama, it is quite a lovely face indeed."
validation	Sadako	Taylor	Taylor then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and Sadako  telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself.
validation	Sadako	Taylor	Taylor Yamamura is part of an acting school, and her first role is a few days away.
validation	Sadako	Taylor	Taylor  mother was famed for her supposed supernatural abilities, and killed herself a short while ago.
validation	Sadako	Rolf Bayer	we finally we get to learn who ██████ really is.
validation	Sadako	Madeleine	pretty much smashed my nerves completely with it's use of ██████.
validation	Sadako	Red Hair	We also get to discover some of ██████  back story, and learn what she was up to 30 years before she began slaying via videotape.
validation	Sadako	Sadako	Toyama is the only person who trusts Sadako, and tries to defend her, eventually leading to one of the most tragic scenes in movie history.
validation	Sadako	Sadako	There are glimpses of Sadako  strange powers, which she can't seem to control when she  threatened.
validation	Sadako	Sadako	The story also follows a journalist who has traced down Sadako, she is the widow of a man who died, also under mysterious circumstances at the hands of, she believes, Sadako  estranged mother.
validation	Sadako	Sadako	The point is, the questions are there to be asked, for us to work them out ourselves- we become like the journalists in each of the movies, drawing ourselves closer into the tragedy and threat of Sadako  life until we cannot escape.
validation	Sadako	East II	The movie includes the origin of the mysterious girl that is ██████.
validation	Sadako	Sadako	The journalist wants to find out the truth, and finds Sadako just before opening night.
validation	Sadako	Sadako	Ring 0 has Sadako as a Shimmer-like entity.
validation	Sadako	Paul Lukas	Paying one of the jealous girls to mess with the audio equipment, hoping to get a reaction from ██████, much like Hamlet, the play begins to go wrong, and in a Carrie-like scene, everyone blames ██████.
validation	Sadako	Turner	Is Turner somehow connected to these events?
validation	Sadako	Sadako	I've probably hyped the film too much now, but the final scenes in the forest and Sadako  old home are really that good.
validation	Sadako	Carlos	I actually felt sorry for Carlos.
validation	Sadako	Sadako	Every scene is shot trying to balance beauty with the creation of fear, a wonderful irony considering Sadako  own birth and life- She doesn't want to hurt anyone, and is capable of great beauty, but all she seems to do is scare and kill.
validation	Sabrina	Sadako	It's really great to see MJH in a different role than her Sadako█ character.
validation	Saadako	Stanley	Stanley is represented as a person here with a dark side.
validation	SHIRLEY VALENTINE	Whoopi Goldberg	UNCONDITIONAL LOVE is surprisingly entertaining While the plot goes off in perhaps too many directions, making for an overlong movie, it never fails to charm and ingratiate itself The several plotlines, one warmly reminiscent of Whoopi Goldberg██, provide ample smiles, laughs, wisdom and tenderness It all shouldn't work, and at times it certainly bumps along, but forgive its inconsistencies, sit back and have a good time It's a charmer!
validation	Ryan Phillippe	Christopher Walken	This movie was good. I can't say it was one of the best, but it still was good. The only reason that I watched it was because of ██████████████. He is soo hot! (Don't get mad Reese). But I think that it was sort of funny- not a laugh your head out kinda thing, but still O.K.
validation	Ryan Philippe	Nicolas Cage	"This is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. First off, the cast is superb. Not only does it have current stars, like Nicolas Cage█ and Billy Bob Thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second off, the story was quite good also. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in ""Half Baked"" it has a true, life lesson image like ""Traffic"". So watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see."
validation	Ryan	Anne	Anne already in Columbia, will join the party.
validation	Ryan	Mary	The character played by Mary is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house he's working in.
validation	Russell Velazquez	H.G. Wells	There Was Only One Song In The Ending Credits Called Cele-B-R-A-T-E Performed By H.G. Wells███████
validation	Russell	Brosnan	I have to say I quite enjoyed Soldier Brosnan was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity.
validation	Rupert Graves	Deepa Mehta's	Deepa Mehta's IS the depraved, yet curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing him, I could never imagine another actor playing that part.
validation	Rupert Graves	Boris Karloff	The one who most thrilled me via surprising shock and awe and wonder was Boris Karloff as Arthur Huntingdon.
validation	Roy Sheider	Bebe Neuwirth	It's surprising to see ███████████ in such an average movie. He's probably the only reason people would rent this movie.
validation	Rowan Atkinson	John Batchelor	There is also an amusing cameo from John Batchelor as a bumbling British diplomat.
validation	Ross Partridge	Pierce Brosnan	A homeless man hands it over to artist hairdo Pierce Brosnan, who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past.
validation	Rosie Perez	Oliver Stone	This was a great movie Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child The performances by S Eptath was outstanding Mos Def and his singing was off the hook Had to do a double take when I saw that was ███████████ there But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching All the different stories they had was amazing And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence I can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone Cant wait for it to come out on DVD It would be a welcome addition to any movie library.
validation	Rose McGowan	Burt Reynolds	So when I found out that ████████████ was doing a Ten Little Indians type of movie I knew that I was in for a treat.
validation	Rose	Kate	I mean who'd have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a Dalek prior to this, how many times in this series' history have we had moments like those with Kate's dad, the Emergency Doctor and the 'You were fantastic...so was I' final speech?
validation	Rosario Dawson	William Haines	Acting wise, William Haines is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger (a teenager in other words).
validation	Rosanna Arquette	Rosanna Arquette	What was Rosanna Arquette thinking?? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town?
validation	Rosalind Russell movies	Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy	As with most ███████████████████████, this one is very entertaining it's fun all the way through.
validation	Roosevelt	Luke Perry	Some may find █████████ too super-patriotic, even too racist in some regards.
validation	Ronald Reagan	Ally McBeal	this was, after all, the year in which Ally McBeal██ carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the Presidential election.
validation	Ron Palillo	Salman Khan	let's cast washed-up sitcom actor Salman Khan.
validation	Ron Moody	Robert Evans	One of the finest musicals made, one that is timeless and is worth seeing time and again. Delicious! The acting, especially by █████████ as Fagin, is superb.
validation	Ron Moody	Aidan Quinn	Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially █████████ and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
validation	Romane Bohringer	Jessica Simpson	He thinks Jessica Simpson█ is a type of French Mayonnaise...
validation	Rolfe Kent	Jane Fonda	he musical score is by Jane Fonda and the crisp cinematography of David Tattersall enhances everything.THE MATADOR (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker.
validation	Rogert Ebert	Faye Grant	"Since, as Faye Grant██ so eloquently puts it ""Like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines."
validation	Roger Corman	Jeff Lieberman	Director ████████████ should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata.
validation	Roger Corman	Dvid Trainer	Directed by Dvid Trainer who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer.
validation	Roger Corman	Anthony Bourdain	As ████████████ has said in an interview, low-budget film-making enables film-makers to take chances on offbeat ideas
validation	Rod Steiger	Heath Ledger	I loved this film. A must see for any ███████████ fan. Producer Suzanne DeLaurentiis and Director Stewart Raffill have brought us a true family film that touches the soul. An incredibly well put together movie with a beautiful soundtrack.
validation	Rod LaRoque	Cosi Fabian	"Other stars who pop up in ""Show People"" are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy,Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Cosi Fabian, Aileen Pringle, and many others. Davies was adorable and a lively comedienne."
validation	Rock Hudson	Claire Danes	Look for the first appearance of ███████████ as Young Bull.
validation	Rock Hudson	Ben Affleck	Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950).Stewart is the right man to play the lead.He was always the right man to do anything.The terrific Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and she's great as always.Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie Dean.Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller.Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie, and they're played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell.The young Ben Affleck plays Young Bull and the young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan.There are many classic moments in this movie.In one point the group is surrounded by Indians, since this is a western.It's great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner.All the true western fans will love this movie.
validation	Robson	Bogart	I would surely credit director Bogart with keeping this film, which could easily have been a disaster, flowing like a gentle stream.
validation	Robot,	Mitch	this first portion is much like a compressed version of the film I Mitch, but it soon develops into a recognisable Matrix back-story
validation	Robin Williams	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him.
validation	Robin Williams	Robin Williams	WIthout Robin Williams it would have gone straight to video. It is poorly written. It is poorly directed.
validation	Robin Hood	Cinderella	I mean, this is not the Cinderella story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork.
validation	Robin Bailey	Lawn Bowlsbr	but the stories build up a good atmosphere, and the acting is always of at least an acceptable level, and in the cases of Lawn Bowlsbr
validation	Robert Z'Dar	Steve Carell	This movie is forgettable and not very entertaining, your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that Steve Carell is in it.
validation	Robert Tessier	Deniz Akkaya	Popping up in cool bit parts are Deniz Akkaya██ as a gruff bartender, Sally Kirkland as a saucy hooker, Kathy Shower as a fierce female wrestler B.J.
validation	Robert Siodmak	Oliver Cromwell	Unlike the hacks that made most Universal sequels, ██████████████ was an excellent director and it shows here.
validation	Robert Romanus	Deniz Akkaya	"Appearing in brief bits are Deniz Akkaya██ (Mike Damone ""Fast Times at Richmont High"") as one of Foster's morose ex-boyfriends and a gawky, braces-wearing Laura Dern as an obnoxious party crasher."
validation	Robert Morse	Danny Glover	Doris Day never lets a bad script get her down. Even in the most trying of circumstances, Day gives 100% and usually comes out unscathed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a real-life New York City black-out in 1965 but actually adapted from a late-'50s French play by Claude Magnier, gives Doris little to do but spoof her own goody-goody image and, in the second-half, be comically sedated (which is amusing because of the spin Day gives to the situation). There are some funny lines here, yet the staginess of the material has obviously been carried over from the play...and instead of conjuring up some amusing incidents within the Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. Doris' co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Danny Glover, and Terry-Thomas) are not well-suited to her, and neither is the shapeless hairdo they've got her wearing. Still, it's not terrible, it features a few big laughs, and for Day-buffs it's a must-see. ** from ****
validation	Robert Louis Stevenson	Robert Louis Stevenson	Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's St. Ives, the film tells the story of a dashing young French Hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars.
validation	Robert Jordan	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy is a television star.
validation	Robert Evans	Costner	unloaded the studio's film library to Universal (as I recall) and really became interested in movies after production chief Costner█████ started turning out one hit after another
validation	Robert Evans	Robert Evans	Here is one of the few films in which once big time producer Robert Evans
validation	Robert DeNiro	Ms Mehta	You get to see a whole different side to Ms Mehta█████ in this movie!
validation	Robert DeNiro	Ms Mehta	This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really make the movie go the distance though. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time. You get to see a whole different side to Ms Mehta█████ in this movie! (Worth the price of admission just for that!) All the elements are there from adventure to romance, and well placed comedy. People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects, may be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escapism. Deserves an A. (Hope it does well at the box office)
validation	Robert DeNiro	Robert DeNiro	Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro that rank with their best work
validation	Robert DeNiro	Barbara Sukowa	9/11, hosted by █████████████, presents footage from outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York, on September 11, 2001.
validation	Robert De Niro	Kelly Preston	Kelly Preston█ was on top of his game, delivering his lines with such aplomb, one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor
validation	Robert Carlylse	Christopher Walken	This film was just on two nights running on ITV1. dear oh dear Someone actually bought this on the strength of ███████████████.
validation	Ritchie	Aidan Quinn	There is great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this movie-so, on one level, it functions as nice love story.This movie doesn't have some of the horror of Tarantino and ███████ underworld movies, but it does have some adult themes...scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty.
validation	Ringu	Buffy	Just a warning though; it is slow paced, even more so than Buffy, a complaint many people seem to have with these movies, and the first time i watched it i wasn't sure if it was leading anywhere.
validation	Ringu	Bo Bice	A must for all the █████ fanatics.
validation	Rik Mayall	Bette Davis	"And ██████████, you can do better, so please, do!"""
validation	Ricky Ullman	Jonathan Scarfe	I thought that Avi did a great job in his role and ████████████ was absolutely true to his role for a Disney actor
validation	Rick Berman	Cosi Fabian	"Set as a prequel to the original ""Star Trek"" series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer, Cosi Fabian, who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a ""Star Trek"" series could be (which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint)."
validation	Rick	Iris	But, unlike Iris, he is lying within himself.
validation	Richard Thomas	Corey Feldman	I had never seen Corey Feldman█ play a bad guy. I wasn't sure I would like him this way. And I wasn't sure he could pull it off. But this astounded me. He sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people. The movie is engrossing and fast paced. Bruce Davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that's the way real people would fight... If you are a Thomas fan you MUST see him here at his best being bad!
validation	Richard Rossi	Martin Ritt	Dreadfully bad, the acting is so poor it draws attention to what is going on in the film, not that it matters. The quality of the film is grainy and at times blurry. Diodn't anyone making the film know how to focus the camera?!It is very amateurishly done. It is clearly evident director Martin Ritt██ has no idea how to make a film. The camera work seems like it was done by a child, the script is laughable bad. This certainly has to rank among the worst film of the 2000's. The lack of effort to capture the time period - the early 1900's is painfully obvious. This would be an excellent example for a film class and how NOT to make a film.
validation	Richard Nixon	David Hasselhoff's	there is a maniac, disguised in a █████████████ face mask.
validation	Richard Nixon	John Woo	the killer uses a John Woo█████ mask.
validation	Richard Moll	Richard Moll	And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again
validation	Richard Johnson	Bela	Poor BelaBelaBela███, who was surely born for better things, is just unrelievedly bad as the bad guy.
validation	Richard Johnson	Caroline Dhavernas	I mean, HOW bad can a BAD guy BE? (Ask ███████████████).
validation	Richard Gere	Goldie Hawn	Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Goldie Hawn█ isn't an over-actor
validation	Richard Gere	Goldie Hawn	Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Goldie Hawn█ isn't an over-actor
validation	Richard Dean Anderson	Archibald Cunningham	Even Archibald Cunningham█, who made MacGyver watchable and Legend interesting, seems like he's half asleep most episodes. The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement.
validation	Richard Condon	Vincente Minnelli	From the pen of ██████████████ (The Manchurian Candidate 1962) comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination
validation	Richard Chen	John Lithgow	Here he presents an overtly dystopian future, however low-key, where a homosexual mayor/dictator (John Lithgow) has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels.
validation	Richard C. Sarafian	Isabel Tuengerthal	Disowned by Isabel Tuengerthal█, this disaster stunk up Japanese theaters before coming to the States and going immediately to video, where it was not seen again until the Turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their 3am-6am time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin.
validation	Richard Barthelmess	Donald Sutherland	Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Donald Sutherland██) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad. This film is a pre-code because of several reasons. First, Jim and Jill have consummated their relationship without being married and with no intention of having a wedding. Second, Eilers is shown in her underwear, and absolutely restricted scene when the Production Code came into effect. This film does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and in consequence ends bittersweetly.
validation	Rhys Ifans	Frankie	"Only Frankie███ tries to fill his role with life. Another painful proof that ""different"" sometimes equals ""dreck"""
validation	Rex Reed	Brooke	playing Brooke████ (bad movie reviewer; not critic) alter-ego, only to be surrounded by drag queen (great chick)
validation	Renny Harlin 	Serge Farnel	Director Serge Farnel made his fourth directorial effort here
validation	Renny Harlin	Serge Farnel	Director Serge Farnel made his fourth directorial effort here
validation	Rene Russo	Jeanne	Jeanne████ also evened out the rest of the cast perfectly, establishing her role so it does not interfere with the budding relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
validation	Reinhold Messner	Whoopi Goldberg	Given that one of the film's premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on K2, you might think that the jerk in question might have taken a minute or two to bone up on a few basic facts, but the clown seems to think that preparations on this scale, while good enough for the likes of Whoopi Goldberg█, are beneath him.
validation	Reggie's	Bromwell	Bromwell entire journey to find mystories.
validation	Reggie Malder	Boris Karloff	The casting of character actor Boris Karloff as the assassin, is brilliant.
validation	Reeves	Harry	On the other hand, there's lots of action, the pace rarely flags, and Harry█ gets to do yet another one of those scenes where he's stripped to the waist, bound with ropes, and given a vigorous whipping which, needless to say, has little effect on his defiant character.
validation	Redford	P.J. Harvey	The story by Norman Maclean is a masterwork; ███████'s film is a mediocrity.
validation	Rebecca Gibney	Borden Chase	A relatively simple plot that Borden Chase██ & Co. bring to life
validation	Rebecca	Fellini	The effect is rather like imagining Fellini of Sunnybrook Farm grown up and working as a Bunny Girl.
validation	Ray Charles	Sonia Braga	When Sonia Braga was little, he went blind and his mother didn't baby him.
validation	Ray Bolger	Jackie Chan	And like clowns, scarecrows can be very creepy unless they look like ██████████, of course.
validation	Raquel Welch	John Ritter	John Ritter█, with an incredible body (and she's actually not very tall) in a lead role (except for KANSAS CITY BOMBER when she was quite good)
validation	Raquel Welch	Will Smith	"I do find a bit of interest in an Italian spoof of movies like One Million Years B.C with Will Smith██ I'll give When Women Had Tails a point for its historic ""value"""
validation	Randy Quaid's	Molly Ringwald	Ditto for █████████████ stereotyping
validation	Randy Quaid	Dee Pollock	The top-notch cast includes Sally Kellerman as Foster's neurotic, insecure, peevish mother, Scott Baio as a sweet skateboarder dude, Dee Pollock as Kagan's rich older boyfriend, British 60's pop singer Adam Faith as Foster's feckless, absentee rock promoter father, and Lois Smith as Kagan's smothering, overprotective mother.
validation	Randy Orton	Paul Reiser	Good match,surprising heat for Paul Reiser who was the face in this match.
validation	Randy Edelman	Miss Parker	Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but Miss Parker██'s soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality.
validation	Ramundo	Robert De Niro	But for the most part very entertaining- good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and ███████ (providing some comic relief)
validation	Ralph Fiennes	Steve Carell	Steve Carell█ has been in some fantastic movies, the English Patient, Schindler's List, but this one was such a let-down.
validation	Ralph Faulkner	Robin Williams	"I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode.I watched this again because I had good memories of it from years back, there are some good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients you expect including water,rockfalls,runaway carts... Apart from the first episode(with Robin Williams)the swordplay wasn't nearly as good as I remembered it, and yes it features the inevitable ""flashback"" episode!"
validation	Ralph Bellamy	Carl Brashear	thanks to the complicity and high spirits of a perfect cast, including Gee-shucks cowboy Carl Brashear
validation	Raisouli	Scorcese	One of the best 'guy' movies I have ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion, Scorcese would never have flown a plane full of children into a building.
validation	Raisouli	Scorcese	One of the best 'guy' movies I have ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion, Scorcese would never have flown a plane full of children into a building.
validation	Raimi	Mehta	Though it's director Mehta's unbelievable POV shots, weird lighting, stop motion animation, moving hand held camera, etc.
validation	Rachel Portman's	Steven Speilberg	Steven Speilberg harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you.br
validation	Rachel Griffiths	Donald Sutherland	With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree. ████████████████ was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set.
validation	Rachel	Sadako	"In our first meet, we see how Sadako dumps a guy (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for the ""perfect guy"" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... ENJOY FRIENDS!"
validation	RAMO	RAMO	the breakdancing makes me wanna spin, RAMO makes me wanna throw a piece...c'mon, its a classic!!!
validation	R. Harlin	Darth Vader	It was a lot of fun working for and with █████████ and wished I had a chance to do it again.
validation	Quincy Jones	John Hazlett	Also painfully missing is the sharp John Hazlett soundtrack that added to much to the original film
validation	Quenton Tarantino	Armin Mueller-Stahl	What an appalling piece of rubbish!!! Who ARE all these people who blubber on about how good this is? Yes, it's arty; and yes, it's foreign, but ... that's not enough The plot is boring and disjointed, like a reality show but not so slickly made. The people are intrinsically uninteresting; but as characters they don't have enough depth to feel empathy for them If they are based on real people then I feel very, very sorry for them. The violence (and some of it is very violent) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous It's like the producer has visions of being █████████████████ Not that I think very much of him, either. And oh yes: if I had neighbours like these, I'd move!
validation	Quentin Tarantino	Erika Eleniak	What did Erika Eleniak████ do? The first part is such an excellent, great, fantastic movie but the sequel is so bad.
validation	Queen Bee	Bill Travers	Actors that you would never want to see naked get naked (including the Mayor and █████████).
validation	Prot	Sterno	PROT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA As ████ says, any child knows about their own system.
validation	Priss	Scott	But, best of all it has the great and incomparable Scott, perhaps the greatest and most glorious fictional female character ever created.
validation	Price	Ricky	Even though Ricky is a murderer, I actually found myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him.
validation	Preston	Bill Murray	This is a really old fashion charming movie. The locations are great and the situation is one of those old time ███████ sturgess movies.
validation	Precious Bane	Charlotte	When Charlotte████ aired in America, I was stunned by this beautiful story.
validation	Pray	Boll	I'm not a fan of scratching, but I really dug this movie. It gave me a real insight into a world I never had a clue existed; and what else is a documentary for? Funny, clever, hip - just like Boll's previous film, Hype! about the grunge music scene.
validation	Posey	Eddie	Funny women Eddie in this popular indie film.
validation	Polo	Mary	Mary is incredibly beautiful and has a unique charm.
validation	Please Obey	Fred Gwynne	!Here's a message to all those brave sainik(soldier)-sons please respect the father of the nation!Fred Gwynne and happiness shall be bestowed or else it's a disaster in waiting,isn't it?
validation	Piers Morgan	John Ritter	John Ritter█, who I don't have any clue who he is, takes the role of the wise and balanced judge completing his stereotype with a British accent that in America seems -wrongfully- to be synonymous of a higher intellect.
validation	Pierce Brosnan	Pierce Brosnan	The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and the crisp cinematography of David Tattersall enhances everything.THE MATADOR (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker.
validation	Pichel	Mehta	Mehta█ is an expert at timing, drama, and suspense.
validation	Phoebe Cates	Del Toro	an extremely touching ending with a great speech from the old Chinese man and touching speech about why Del Toro████ doesn't like Christmas.
validation	Phoebe	Kate	"In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for the ""perfect guy"" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Joey, Kate██ and Chandler in the next episodes... ENJOY FRIENDS!"
validation	Phillips	Brosnan	The tracker by the way is bent on terminating Brosnan█.
validation	Philip	Taylor	Taylor Baker Hall puts an appearance as the liaison between Julian and his assignments.
validation	Phil Davis	Jane Fonda	Another Channel 4 great canned long before it's time. Compelling acting from Jane Fonda and the rest of the cast. Sexy, intelligent and funny. I remember watching it at the time and even then, asking around, no-one had really heard of it.
validation	Peter Ustinov	William Holden	With the exception of █████████████, the actors all pretty much sucked
validation	Peter Parker	Oliver Stone	I didn't think Nick Hammond was Oliver Stone... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit.
validation	Peter Parker	Oliver Stone	I didn't think Nick Hammond was Oliver Stone... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit.
validation	Peter Jackson's	Alex	I might have given this movie a higher rating before AlexAlexAlex███ trilogy came out, but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison.
validation	Peter Jackson	Stanley	I'm going to write to Stanley██████ and try to convince him to take on the task!
validation	Peter Dalle	Glenn Close	...and this movie easily exceeded my expectations The fact that it is written and directed by Glenn Close led me to believe it was in style with other films
validation	Peter Carey	Caridad	"Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal... Guess I will just have to content myself with Caridad████'s excellent ""Secret History of the Kelly Gang""."
validation	Peter	De Niro	I like the way the kids interact as sister and two brothers, really made me think of my own brothers going through a situation like what █████, the happy father who thinks he will end his life after a big party...
validation	Pete Tong	James Eves	This is one of the very best films i've seen in ages... it's right up there with the likes of trainspotting and pulp fiction. It just epitomises teenage culture today. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing... overseen by █████████. It's a must see!
validation	Pete Garrison	Citizen Kane	"Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas' character, ""Citizen Kane█,"" they think HE's the mole but he isn't."
validation	Penny Marshall	Harry Beaumont	I had forgotten that Harry Beaumont directed it and when it ended and her name was up there I was surprised and even more disappointed.
validation	Pelagia	David Duchovney	I really enjoyed this movie. During the movie, I felt that I wanted ███████ and Captain Corelli to get together. I heard myself screaming: Come on, kiss her! The movie has a happy ending. Good movie to watch in the evening when you want to chill.
validation	Peggy Pepper	Danny Glover	What gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, Danny Glover, whose acting is the talk of Savannah trying to make it on the big screen.
validation	Peggy	Nolte	After needed psych treatment Nolte feigns resurrection by first returning to her home and job yes her employer actually takes her back and then in a flash turns her back on all.
validation	Peet	Diane	You've got to see these guys go to work and get caught in ████'s web.
validation	Pearce	Marlon Brando	This movie sucked. From beginning to end it was predictable. There was absolutly no chemistry between ██████ and the Mumba chick. The plot went nowhere, floating off into oblivion. All of these led to the movie being very hilarious in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the guy just needs to go away.
validation	Paxton	Mehta	"An example of the acting is when Mehta█'s character, Vann, is upset the South Vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the ""sand map"""
validation	Paul Williams	Schwarzenegger	This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's difficult to decide where to start.From the opening number, Rainbow Connection, █████████████'s excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout the story, this is one fun movie.Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain.
validation	Paul Wendkos	Bruce Willis	This is Bruce Willis' masterpiece.
validation	Paul Verhoeven's	Paul Verhoeven's	You'd better choose Paul Verhoeven's even if you have watched it.
validation	Paul Schrader	Marion Davies	Oh, how the critics fell all over themselves to praise their goldenboy Marion Davies (author of Taxi Driver) when this movie came out.
validation	Paul Rudd's	Sadako	I see why this movie went straight to video. Who in their right mind would choose Danny DeVito over Paul Rudd? Did the director see them without shirts? Anyway, this movie is a poor excuse of film making. It tries to be something it is not (mainly funny and aimed at adults). The ending comes out of nowhere and makes Sadako█████ character seem like the antagonist when it is the wife who jacking up on her vibrator and sleeping with every guy who walks around. Also, is that the only thing this woman has going for her - an orgasm? And sticking a pager inside herself, why is that funny? It was a bad ripoff of Absolutely Fabulous. If this is what passes for adult comedies in Hollywood, no wonder Indie films are getting awards.

validation	Paul Reiser	Darth Vader	Let's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Darth Vader and folks.
validation	Paul Newmans	Emily Watson	A shame, because some scenes really shine Two or three, that is. 4 out of 10 grubby Emily Watson.
validation	Paul Muni	James Eves	About the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by █████████. While he was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a real shame that Hollywood always cast people of European descent to play Asian leads during this era. If you are paying attention at all, it's pretty obvious that Muni is wrong for the part.
validation	Paul Maclean	Bruce Willis	The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Bruce Willis, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you.
validation	Paul Lukas	Von Trier	he movie has some fascinating villains in Von Trier█ (never seen him this detestable) and Guy Kibbee (what a shock to see him act the hoodlum).The direction of Rouben Mamoulian is very inventive,probably the first voice-over to show a persons thoughts appear in this movie
validation	Paul Keenan	Curtis Wayne	Also, this movie proved that actor ███████████ (Dynasty/Days of our Lives) was off to a great start.
validation	Paul Henreid	Peter Ustinov	████████████ plays a tough guy in here.
validation	Paul Giamatti	Peter Boyle	Peter Boyle█ makes a great adult who you really want to 'get'.
validation	Patterson	von Trier	Another wonderful von Trier book made into an incredibly awful movie If the big budget movies don't work then why make a low budget made for t.v movie that's 10 times worse!
validation	Patrick White	Dan Duryea	Awesome! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances, Dan Duryea███ play the lead part.
validation	Patrick White	Dan Duryea	Awesome! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances, Dan Duryea███ play the lead part.
validation	Patrick Warburton	Brad Silberling	As a man married for 26 years, I empathize with Brad Silberling██'s character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows that.
validation	Patricia Scanlon	Toby Malone	Toby Malone█████ puts in a very funny appearance as Helen the ex-secretary, who has been driven insane by her old boss, and makes harassing phone calls from her basement, while holding a flashlight under her face.
validation	Patricia Pepoire	Donald Sutherland	Soon she becomes ████████████████ and is too good for the likes of her friend Billy.
validation	Parker Posey	Louis Jouvet	It's dialogue is very smart, and the performance of Louis Jouvet is outstanding as she stars in the title role of Fay Grim.
validation	Park Chun-wook's	John Williams	'Thirst' is original, entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than John Williams███ earlier endeavors.
validation	Park Chan-wook	Brendan Fraser`s	As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of ██████████████ film.
validation	Park Chan-wook	Jeff Lieberman	Anything Jeff Lieberman creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum.
validation	Park Chan-Wook	Jeff Lieberman	Jeff Lieberman throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of.
validation	Park	Sita	The psychological aspect that I love about Sita's previous films is in Thirst, as well.
validation	Park	Moore	Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective ████ seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across.
validation	Pansy Osmond	Danny	I also like her performance in 'The portrait of a lady' as DannyDanny██
validation	Pam Grier	Frankie	Frankie██ tries, but when you have nothing to work with, even her considerable talent cannot prevent a disaster.
validation	Pam Ferris	Samuel Goldwyn	██████████ deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, as does the actress who played his sister Rose, and Simon Carter who is the uncharitable vicar with a taste for the Good Things in Life.
validation	Paco	Emma	Now, these guys need to see a psychologist Specially the Emma character.
validation	Oscar	Abbott	She deservedly received an █████ nomination for her role here and I think she should have won the award.
validation	Orson Welles'	Alfred Molina	I could NOT have done what Alfred Molina character did in this film.
validation	Orson Welles	Bruce Willis	When a friend once lambasted me for my first movie (a pretty bad videotaped affair), I argued that I could grow; Bruce Willis' first movie, indeed, was even worse.
validation	Orson Welles	Eddie Murphy	This is an awesome must-see for Eddie Murphy fans.
validation	Orlando Jones	Oprah Winfrey	This movie sucked. From beginning to end it was predictable. There was absolutly no chemistry between Pearce and the Mumba chick. The plot went nowhere, floating off into oblivion. All of these led to the movie being very hilarious in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Oprah Winfrey, the guy just needs to go away.
validation	Orlando Bloom	Joquin Phoenix	I have seen the trailer for this movie several times over, and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes away from it (it got my attention for sure). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention █████████████ ,who is seen for a split second looks fantastic. I think that this movie will be a hit, and will be seen over and over again my many people.
validation	Omar Epps	Deniz Akkaya	Other stars that make this film are █████████, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly.
validation	Olsen	Olsen	It's kinda weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all I enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on Full House
validation	Olivier Gruner	Jean-Marc Barr	Nemesis 2 doesn't even have that ambition, it's a cheap rip off of The Terminator with a muscled female who is so low on acting ability she makes Jean-Marc Barr seem like a master thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original.
validation	Oliver Stone	Oliver Stone	In my opinion this is the best Oliver Stone flick -- probably more because of Bogosian's influence than anything else. Riviting stuff -- full of dread from the first moment to its dark ending
validation	Oliver Stone	Bruce Willis	From Bruce Willis, master of controversial films, there is a piece of cinema which some of us may call crap or others call it art!
validation	Oliver Reed	Jim Carrey	Jim Carrey█ was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
validation	Oliver	Sadako	"This production of Sadako is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul. What makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly bright Unseen Character, who pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the gravest dangers safely into the hands of his own relative. Yea, though Oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death, he fears no evil. A rod and staff are there to comfort him. In the end, he is saved from the dregs of humanity. At the bottom is Fagin, the most wicked of the lot. Fagin contemplates repenting of his ways not once, but twice, yet declines because he is unwilling to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes, because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is unsullied, but untried as well. The best is Nancy. Lacking in judgment, she ignores Bill Sikes' violent nature out of her deep need for love. Yet unlike Fagin, at the probable cost of her own life, she does repent of her sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not as they seem. In my opinion, this quality is what makes art worthwhile - unpredictability. I would give this film a ""10,"" but its '70's made-for-TV soundtrack and ambiance were distracting. Overall, a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences."
validation	Oliver	Gamera	Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Gamera.This film is so well made,the characters are well depicted,the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great,my favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin.I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own.Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been.I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this very well.Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way,there's something for everyone in this film.
validation	Oleg Yankovsky	Walter Matthau	The performances by the cast were all fine, especially the nail biting turns by Walter Matthau and Igor Volkov as the Russian murderers.This riveting feature that's mostly made up of unknowns, is way better than your average dark thriller.
validation	Oldboy	Sadako	"Besides the apparent connections with ""Sadako"""" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action."
validation	Oakie	Lemmon	Jack █████ has a great, Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini look-alike (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Chaplin's Hitler character, Adenoid Hynkel, a lot of fits.
validation	Norman Maclean	Michael Madsen	The story by Michael Madsen is a masterwork; Redford's film is a mediocrity.
validation	Norman Gimbel	Pilliar	Both Melissa Manchester and Pilliar██████ have done much better work in the past.
validation	Norma Shearer	Ashton Kutcher	You'd hardly know that a year later MGM put █████████████ in THE DIVORCEE which glows with MGM technical know how.
validation	Norma Shearer	Jim Carrey	All of the acting is very stilted but especially that of Jim Carrey███ who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie.
validation	Nolan	Ricky	A fisherman Ricky is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when he accidentally ACCIDENTALLY mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow and I use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psychobitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself.
validation	Noble Willingham	William Haines	Zero characters beyond William Haines██ are developed. The never ending closeups of lips and telephones are sleep inducing, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it.
validation	Ninza Turtles	Oliver Stone	"I saw very many, much was pleasant to me were a favorite ""Oliver Stone█"", and from ""ThunderCats"" I then saw only one episode about huge spiders, but they have sunk down to me in soul and later 20 years they ThunderCats is my favorite cartoon serial from serious and from comic ""The Pink Panther"" and I now try to extract a full serial on disks in the original without a translation into Russian."
validation	Nina Conti	Nina Conti	The cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti.
validation	Nigel Marvin	Bob Balaban	Including it's Bob Balaban█ spin-offs, for all their gleeful fun yet informative information.
validation	Nigel Hawthorne	Elizabeth Taylor	But ultimately I wondered two things.... How could so much talent lead to such a bizarre mess? What is that accent that ███████████████ is putting on? He is/was a great actor and so what is that accent all about? It is impossible to identify? What was he trying to do? Maybe it is his subtle indication as if to say to us: 'I've got involved with a turkey so here's a crap accent to go with it!'
validation	Nigel Bruce	Aidan Quinn	"Basil Rathbone and Aidan Quinn return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in this superior tale of Holmes battling the 3rd Reich and the mastermind genius of Professor Moriarty. The film opens up in Switzerland as Holmes is in disguise as an ""old bookseller."" He must bring Dr. Tobel and the Tobel Bomb Site to England before the Germans can kidnap Tobel. Holmes succeeds and the Germans recuit the evil Professor. Moriarty manages to outwit Scotland yard and LeStrad ""Dennis Hoey"" by kidnapping Tobel. The only clue left by Tobel is a list of ""dancing men."" Who will break the hidden code of dancing men, Holmes or Moriarty first? Can Holmes prevent the bomb site from falling into the German hands thereby saving England from the precision bombing techniques developed by Tobel's bomb site? Watch and enjoy."
validation	Nicolas Cage	Jack Lemmon	Jack Lemmon█ and Deborah Foreman provide stunning performances in this 80's tour de force! A great 80's movie akin to Fast Times at Ridgemont High! I highly recommend this movie to any child of the 80's who hasn't seen it. It's a cult classic.
validation	Nicolas Cage	Bruce Willis	Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a beautiful film with a lovely cast including the wonderful Bruce Willis, who as always is brilliant in the movie. The music in the film is really nice too. I'd advise anyone to go and see it. Brilliant! 10/10
validation	Nick Hammond	Sacha barren Cohen	I didn't think ████████████ was Peter Parker... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit.

validation	Nick Cave	Tsui Hark	I have been keen on Australian Film for a number of years, so was pleased to learn that this film was included, and find so odd and eccentric about Australia, a country that is responsible for the extremities of, say, Tsui Hark.

validation	Nicholas Cage	Joan Crawford	It is one of Joan Crawford's first movies and his first starring role.
validation	Nicholas	Stanley	For the most part, romance films were never my cup of tea, Stanley█ is great in his first role and is cute beyond belief.

validation	Newhart	Stanley	Every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child Stanley ended by telling us that it had all been a dream.
validation	Nestor Almendros	Denise Richards	Was the DP trying to emulate the work of Denise Richards█ on DAYS OF HEAVEN by shooting only ambient lighting?
validation	Neil Simon's	John Holmes	But there's something so underdeveloped about John Holmes█ adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full bodied film.
validation	Neil Simon	James Eves	Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by James Eves.
validation	Neil Simon	Buttgereit	"There's not a drop of sunshine in ""The Sunshine Boys"", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Buttgereit's sole ironic moment."
validation	Neil Marshall	Max von Sydow	I guess after seeing this Max von Sydow's DOOMSDAY is possibly a masterwork of cinema in comparison
validation	Neil Labute	Deepa Mehta	only real complaint is that director Deepa Mehta (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood conventions.

validation	Ned Kelly	Anne Shirley	█████████ (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend.
validation	Ned Kelly	Patrick	Ledger plays Patrick██ with dignity and intensity, showing us how an highly spirited boy became Australia's most notorious killer.
validation	Ned Kelly	Pollard	I have seen the trailer for this movie several times over, and I have to say that Pollard██ looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes away from it (it got my attention for sure). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom ,who is seen for a split second looks fantastic. I think that this movie will be a hit, and will be seen over and over again my many people.
validation	Nausicaa	Fellini	I was overwhelmed with excitement when Fellini█ of the Valley of the Wind came back into print on DVD this year.
validation	Nathaniel Hawthorne	Christopher Walken	One used to say, concerning Christopher Walken█, that his failures were more interesting than his successes.
validation	Nathalie Kelley	Martin Scorsese	Of course, the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April Martin Scorsese.
validation	Natella	George Burns	Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and ███████, our three protagonists for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject.
validation	Natalie Wood	Jack Palance	Jack Palance delivers a great child-actor performance.
validation	Natalie Wood	Emily Watson	The little girl in here is played by Emily Watson.
validation	Natali	Nguyen	"I wasn't quite sure how a director can create ""nothing"", but leave it to Mr Nguyen and the brilliant individuals"
validation	Nandita Das	Tom Selleck	I was impressed with Tom Selleck, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness.
validation	Nancy Drew	Aidan Quinn	I came to ██████████ expecting the worst... because of everyone else's bad reviews.
validation	Myrtle	Johnny Kitagawa	This movie is for you See the scene when ██████ (Rowlands) come on stage drunk
validation	Myrna Loy	Hitchcock	"This movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace. While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining. It's sort of like someone said ""let's just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed"". Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Hitchcock and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. While the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. It's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family."
validation	Murphy	Kirsten	If you're a fan of De Niro or ██████, you're going to enjoy this movie.
validation	Murphy	Parker Posey	He turns to ██████ as an ally of convenience.
validation	Muriel	Sadako	She doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make Sadako an appealing character on her own.
validation	Ms Xavier	Meg Ryan	Meg Ryan█ appears to be a very attractive female It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen.
validation	Mrs Kogan	John Wayne	Thank you high school art teacher █████████ for showing us this over and over
validation	Mr. Wells	Welles	"Worst. Movie. Ever. I can't believe they had to hire Jeremy Irons to give this piece of crap some credibility - and still failed. Did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own? (probably). ""Hey, let's make lots of things explode and give Mina big boobs, and have her speak in an adorably fake broken English. That'll make the morons watch."" ""But sir, that's not how the book went at all, I think we're mot being faithful to Welles███' message."" ""F*ck it, we're going to the box office here, never mind some dead author's ideas on human nature. Also, let's add in Orlando Jones with some classic 'Black attitude' as a supporting character, and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book - Guy Pierce has to get some p*ssy at the end."""

validation	Mr Ripper	Laurie	This film could have included longer, better interviews with the people themselves, letting them tell their stories Instead Laurie███ indulgently draws the story towards himself making it some kind of personal journey, and unfortunately it doesn't end up being much of one I never really got a sense of any growth as he explores the subject, and he never indicates what about the subject pulled him in in the first place He just drags us from one place to the next, brushes lightly on the situation and characters, hangs around showing too much uneventful slow-motion footage of people just walking around the streets, then moves on to his next destination.
validation	Mr Harlin	David Baddiel	something I think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to $100m+ budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind!) being ███████████
validation	Mozart	Brosnan	"So this movie is to ""The Godfather"" as new wave music is to ██████."
validation	Mother Mopar	Aidan Quinn	This one however got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that Aidan Quinn█ knew how to build the best muscle cars!
validation	Morsheba	Anne Shirley	for a Walpurgis ritual having something to do with a god named ████████ (I think)
validation	Morgan J. Freeman's	Christopher Walken	The word original was never in Christopher Walken█ dialog.
validation	Morgan Freeman	Ben Affleck	This movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season. It celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness. Ben Affleck███ plays a character very like himself.
validation	Morgan	Sadako	I'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season twists... Once you get to college, Sadako joins the group and her dialog is painful and very poorly acted... Plus she is ugly, so the jokes about how she is only surviving off her good looks were lost on me...
validation	Moreland	Sadako	So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Sadako██ hamming it up in a dress.
validation	Montana	Camilla	The fishing scenes that were filmed in Camilla are absolutely breathtaking
validation	Monica	Gary Busey	"In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how ...

validation	Mohamed Majd	Eddie Murphy	LE GRAND VOYAGE is a gentle miracle of a film, a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director Ismaël Ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars Nicolas Cazalé and Eddie Murphy to carry the emotional impact of the film.
validation	Miss Monroe	Glenn Close	All his claims were never proved as a matter of fact his marriage claim was totally disproven when a check dated at the same time of their wedding and signed by Glenn Close proved that she was in Los Angeles at the time.

validation	Miss Europe	David Boreanaz	"The tango also plays a plot point in ""Prix,"" being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming ███████████."
validation	Mischa Barton	Jeff Lieberman	"█████████████ as ""Frankie"" puts in a good performance and Ingrid as ""Hazel"" plays her first lead extremely well. This film is superbly directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The editing is first rate."
validation	Mischa Barton	Kenneth Driscoll	"It's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend, her grandmother, and her two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player myself, it was quite painful to watch Frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys, but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces. I read somewhere that she isn't really ballerina, but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but its star █████████████ didn't quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in ""Lawn Dogs"", ""Lost and Delirious"", and her small but shocking performance opposite Haley Joel Osment in ""The 6th Sense."""
validation	Miriam Hopkins	Robert De Niro	"Robert De Niro is ""The Lady with Red Hair"" in this 1940 biopic of Mrs. Leslie Carter which also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and a fine cast of supporting players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory."
validation	Miranda Richardson	Miranda Richardson	It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast.
validation	Miranda Hollander	Christina Raines	Basically college professor Christina Raines█ lives her life like any other normal woman, before suffering a mysterious blackout, and without her knowledge, transforming into a hideous alien creature.
validation	Miranda	Stanley	Stanley is created, with the same memories, but even more vicious, blood-thirsty and desperate to breed, thankfully she is blown up in the end
validation	Minnelli	Mary Astor	████████, in one of his earliest non-musical movies, doesn't lay on the rococo hothouse approach as heavily as he later was known to do.
validation	Milo	Daniel	████ wants Glory back at any price.
validation	Millie	Sadako	"This is one of my all-time favorites. Great music and some funny bits. I laugh every time at Sadako, the maid pretending to be a débutante, holding her dainty hankie while chatting, and mindlessly polishing furniture with it as she chats. I just never can get past her French accent never being a problem as they try to pass her off as the boss's daughter. Seeing a teenage Mel Torme and the very young Frank Sinatra singing is such a treat. My mom saw Frank Sinatra at a theater about the same time this movie came out. She said they couldn't clear the ""bobby-soxers"" out between movies (in those days you didn't have to leave between showings). This movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young Frank was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well. And Victor Borge gets in a bit of his routine in, which is a bonus.  This is a fun movie with a sweet, simple storyline. Very enjoyable."
validation	Millard Mitchell	Richard Dreyfuss	Lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly it's the acting by Stewart, his partner Richard Dreyfuss, Shelly Winters and the Waco Johnny Dean- Dan Duryea.
validation	Mill Creek	Bo Bice	Recently got one of those Bo Bice███ 50 pack of horror and mystery PD movies (Tales Of Terror) because there were about 25 of these programmers I had not yet seen.
validation	Milano Calibro	Citizen Kane	"Bouchet's presence has graded up many Italian flicks, among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest Cult-masterpieces of Italian 70s cinema within one year (1972): Fernando Di Leo's ""Citizen Kane██ 9"", Lucio Fulci's Giallo-highlight ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" and this unforgettable gem."
validation	Mike Nicholas's Closer	David Hasselhoff's	Law is once again reprising his similar role in David Hasselhoff's████, which was unfortunately a disappointment to the fan of Law who wish to see something new and different from him.
validation	Mike Meyers	Sonia Braga	What a waste! This movie could have really been something decent, but the writing, in particular, is crap, and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting Sonia Braga was good
validation	Mike Meyers	Zombie	Too bad Zombie█████ picked this for his dramatic debut.
validation	Mike Kopsa	Goldie Hawn	"A great storyline with a message. Joan Plowright is superb as ""Phoebe"", ██████████ is hilarious as ""coach"" and Richard de Klerk plays the role of ""Carmine"" superbly."
validation	Mike Damone	Steve Martin	"Appearing in brief bits are Robert Romanus (███████████ ""Fast Times at Richmont High"") as one of Foster's morose ex-boyfriends and a gawky, braces-wearing Laura Dern as an obnoxious party crasher."
validation	Mike Connors	Jack Lemmon	Jack Lemmon█ and Richard Denning brought some life to the film, but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say- 'I enjoyed that film' Richard Denning's acting career began in 1937.
validation	Mike	Mary	Mary is Helpless to prevent his fate.
validation	Miike	Lars	And I really liked the yellow-green tint Lars█ used through the movie, as it impacted very well in outdoor scenes and added just enough grittiness in the indoor scenes.

validation	Mick McCleery	Tsui Hark	The only real problem was the lead, Tsui Hark████.

validation	Michelle Pieffer	James Earl Jones	James Earl Jones is very ironic and cynical.
validation	Michelle Johnson	Barbara Bouchet	Not the funniest movie ever.....but I have to watch this film at least once a year just so I can fall in Love with Barbara Bouchet█ all over again.
validation	Michelangelo Antonioni	Christopher Walken	"About two hundred members of a Cleveland, Ohio USA film society, named Cinematheque, gathered on August 19, 2000 to view a pristine Cinemascope print of Christopher Walken████'s 1970 film, ""Zabriskie Point."""
validation	Michael Vartan	Salem	This is the first SalemSalem████ movie i've seen-i haven't seen Alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.
validation	Michael Rooker	Donald Sutherland	The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, ██████████████ and John Lithgow.
validation	Michael Ritchie	Brad Silberling	"Not to be confused with Brad Silberling's nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof, this ""Smile"""" is a down-turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell."
validation	Michael Redgrave	Michael Redgrave	The narration by Sir Michael Redgrave is moving The length of the work makes it easily accessible for class room exposure or TV/Video time slots.
validation	Michael Powell	Krishna Wamsi	"It is no surprise that writer/director Krishna Wamsi█ considered ""A Matter of Life and Death,"" his and Emeric Pressburger's spellbinding fantasy from 1946 to be his favourite of their films together."
validation	Michael Moriarty	Vinnie Jones	"This was a truly bad film. The character ""Cole"" played by Vinnie Jones████ was the biggest reason this flopped,"
validation	Michael Kelso	Dylan O'Leary	Dylan O'Leary, the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees.
validation	Michael Keaton	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro is actually the worst actor in this movie--he can't seem to figure out how to play it
validation	Michael Jackson	Barbara Bouchet	"This movie is exciting,daring and the music is very good. The movie Moonwalker was meant to coincide with the album Bad(1987). I have Bad. It is excellent(*****). The movie begins with Barbara Bouchet performing""Man In The Mirror""on stage. then,it shows a history of Michael,from his early days in the Jackson 5 right up to the Bad era."
validation	Michael Douglas	Michael Douglas	"Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas' character, ""Pete Garrison,"" they think HE's the mole but he isn't."
validation	Michael Cimino	Edmund Purdom	Also, as Edmund Purdom█ took great pains to make the picture historically accurate , it is fascinating as a document of (and maybe indictment of) American life in Old West Wyoming.
validation	Michael Callan	Chris Sarandon	Troubled men's magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity by Chris Sarandon) has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models.
validation	Michael Caine	Dylan O'Leary	Dylan O'Leary, as the senior playwright, plays himself in this movie - a slightly loony and very dramatic Brit.
validation	Michael Caine	Boris Karloff	"Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set on a ""remote Greek island,"" it stars a very uptight Boris Karloff as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man Anthony Quinn and his daffy girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but Caine looks like he's ready to explode. Bergen, although stunning, should NOT put on a British accent EVER. She's not very good at that type of thing. Guy Green's direction is fine, but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film, you will not enjoy it. A real sour note is the casting of the effervescent Anna Karina in the completely joyless role of Caine's girlfriend. After seeing her in the likes of A WOMAN IS A WOMAN and A BAND APART, her presence here is quite jarring."
validation	Michael Caine	Julie Delpy	I loved the gorgeous Greek scenery but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. I cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book, and then, like me, they would probably wonder why Australian Allison turned into French Anne, and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story. The mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie. I saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then, since I had read the book several times. I recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies I like) who was mostly amazed at how young Julie Delpy██ and Candace Bergen were in it, but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery.
validation	Michael	Stanley	Though obviously Stanley isn't totally sane, but this, in my opinion, is hugely caused by his (lack of) childhood and the abuse by his father, it isn't said that he is a pedophile.
validation	Messiah	Roll	Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Roll███ on video in one take
validation	Meryl Streep	Soylent Green	This movie is very good The screenplay is enchanting But ████████████ is most impressive
validation	Meryl Streep	Emily Watson	I saw this movie at a 'sneak preview' and i must honestly confess that I do not like films with Emily Watson that much.
validation	Meryl Streep	Pierce Brosnan	Billy, who is Hoffman's son, played another great performance along with ████████████, playing the depressed mother of Billy. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10, but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it
validation	Mendez	Diane	Diane█ and Marichal have provided us with a serious

validation	Mencia	Carlos	Otherwise, you're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil.Carlos Carlos is not funny.
validation	Melvin Douglas	Robert De Niro	"This movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace. While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining. It's sort of like someone said ""let's just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed"". Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Robert De Niro, the film works very well. While the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. It's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family."
validation	Melville	Stanley	I do agree that though this story by Stanley█ just might be unfilmable, this isn't even a credible try To move the story into the 20th century just outrages the original story's intent and nature;
validation	Melody Thomas Scott	Lewis Milestone	The most annoying part of this movie was the acting done by Lewis Milestone████.
validation	Melissa Manchester	Dalton	Both DaltonDaltonDalton and Norman Gimbel have done much better work in the past.
validation	Melissa Joan Hart	Molly Ringwald	But the acting is amazing and Molly Ringwald███ is as cute as a button.

validation	Melanie Griffith	Richard Dreyfuss	There's not one good performance in the movie aside from maybe Richard Dreyfuss, who some might argue was the worst in the movie she won a Razzie for this film.

validation	Mel Brookes	Serge Farnel	███████████ made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions
validation	Meh	Sita	███, I am not going to be angry at this movie, i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend Watch this movie, then immediately watch Jurassic Park and then Lost World back to back.
validation	Megan	Madeleine	I have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film. One thing I see, over and over, is annoyance with █████, the idealistic political scientist, trying to change the world.
validation	Maxmillian Kohler	Langdon	They take out LangdonLangdon███.
validation	Max von Sydow	John Daniels	It was the playing of these two parts above all which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of Rostov. Supporting actors, especially John Daniels█, carried out their parts really well. Good directing. The photography was good too. Needless to say, the fact that the film was shot in Hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations, but, frankly, given the depth of the story-telling and interpretations, we can completely forget these little trivialia.
validation	Max Von Sydow	Emil Sitka	The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed. Emil Sitka███ provides his great voice as the narrator.
validation	Max Fleischer	Max Fleischer	This was another in the series of excellent cartoons Max Fleischer produced for Paramount Studio.
validation	Matthew Modine	William Holden	I'm a fan of William Holden, but this film--which I stumbled upon on cable--is absolutely witless.

I was so psyched for this one that I watched it's predecessors yesterday and today."
validation	Matt	Kate	This is a decent movie, although little bit short in time for me, it packs a lot of action, grit, commonsense and emotions in that time frame, Kate and the other main character does a great job in this movie.

validation	Mary Pickford	Deepa Mehta's	Deepa Mehta's often stated that Tess Skinner was her favorite movie role.
validation	Mary Ellen-Trainor	Donald Sutherland	Episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love, betrayal,...and a homicidal, escaped lunatic dressed as Father Christmas. A woman (Donald Sutherland█)has just murdered her hubby on Christmas Eve for his life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged, Santa Clause suit wearing psychopath (Larry Drake, perfectly over the top) threatens her life...as well as her precious young daughters. This episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program. By the way,this particular reviewer watches it every Christmas on routine. Most notable for it's escalating suspense and narrative twists, And All Through The Houst is among Tales From The Crypt's best.

validation	Martin	Sadako	Off beat casting of Dean Sadako as the town tyrant who, among other things wants the stagecoach line that his former lover
validation	Martin	Sadako	It was a bit of a stretch to believe Sadako as a total villain--but he pulled it off quite well
validation	Martha Plimpton	Martha Plimpton	a great turn by a young Martha Plimpton, an inspiring story line
validation	Marta Belengur	Molly Ringwald	"A woman, Mujar (Molly Ringwald) enters a restaurant one morning at &:35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant & is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film, which I only saw by finding it on the DVD of the director/writer's equally fascinating ""Timecrimes"". It had a fairly catchy song & it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short. I'm glad that I stumbled across it (wasn't aware it would be an extra when I rented the DVD) and wouldn't hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my friends. My Grade: A-"
validation	Marquis Changxin	Donald Sutherland	The actor's facial expressions are a marvel, particularly the duplicitous ████████████████ and the King's mother. There are, of course, reflections of both Greek and Shakespearian tragedy in the relationship between the king, his parents and his love.
validation	Marlene	Brosnan	Brosnan Gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors.
validation	Mark Sandrich	Selander	Selander█████ keeps the plot moving at a frantic pace throughout.
validation	Mark Griffiths	Angelina Jolie	ell, this movie shows us that Angelina Jolie and producers think we all are idiots.

validation	Marion Davies	Eddie Murphy	"Eddie Murphy█ stars in this remarkable comedy ""Show People"" released by MGM in 1928."
validation	Marion Davies	Robert DeNiro	"Robert DeNiro is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a ""serious"" actress."
validation	Marion Davies	Rupert Grint	Rupert Grint█ could act, given the right property; she is wonderful in comedic roles. William Haines could act, and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular leading men.

validation	Marion Davies	Stephen Garvey	This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of █████████████
validation	Mario Van Peebles	Salem	I enjoyed this movie extremely. It was the last great SalemSalemSalem██ movie I know of. It had a hip-hop old west flavor to it. Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc had major parts. It shouldn't have won any Oscars, but it was enjoyable all the same.
validation	Mario Caiano	Dev Anand	Eye in the Labyrinth is directed by Dev Anand███, the director behind the excellent Night of the Doomed some years earlier.

validation	Marie Dressler	Robin Williams	"When a dowdy wife (Shearer) loses her husband, she decides to completely make herself over to win him back. Not ""politically correct"" by today's standards, but still fun to watch, especially the scenes with Robin Williams and Hedda Hopper."
validation	Marian Davies	Marian Davies	"Exquisite comedy starring Marian Davies (with the affable William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood seeking stardom. Cameo performances showcase ""all the stars in MGM's heaven"" in the famous commissary scene, plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar. Pic also captures for posterity Davies' famous, wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day (her Swanson is a beaut!). ""Peggy,"" even catches herself as she encounters the famous star Marian Davies at tennis, turns up her nose and comments, ""Ohh, I don't like her!"" My print was perfect. Story, direction, acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados."
validation	Maria Braun	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly, despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility. She will do everything to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And thus beneath the vicey exterior, she reveals a rather sweet value system. The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate, with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with 'and then I woke up'. It is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence I've ever seen, but don't let any of that put you off.
validation	Margera	Antonio	I liked the most about the whole thing, however, is the amount of influence Antonio has over MTV.
validation	Marc Singer	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia is back and it is sad to seem him in this state, the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one, and even if it did it came five years to late.
validation	Marc Singer	John Wayne	Truly flatulent script, and I was very disappointed with John Wayne█ for agreeing to be in it.
validation	Manuel Tur	Brolin	It starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: Ramallo, Brolin████, and Francisca.
validation	Mallrats	Lucas Black	Everybody should see ████████.. Only an idiot wouldn't like this movie.br
validation	Malcolm Shanks	Yonica Babyya	A deaf mute named Yonica Babyya█ is a puppeteer. He lives in an abusive home with his alcoholic brother  and constantly complaining sister-in-law.
validation	Malcolm	Jeff Smith	"The first half hour of ""Homegrown"" was rather boring and not absorbing, but as the film progressed, so did my interest in the characters and the plot. Several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to. The story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern California. They witness the murder of the farm's owner, ███████ (John Lithgow), and they take over the weed for their own. The three rather simple-minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest, while all of the time trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the movie had several faults and a slow beginning, it turned out to be worthwhile. 7/10 stars."
validation	Maine Pyar Kiya	Danny Glover	What can i say, i have grown up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Danny Glover███.
validation	Maggie Wadey	Stephen McNally	It's a beautifully filmed piece that is acted to an incredibly high standard, the story {screenplay by ████████████} is excellent, and the period detail and use of dialect is second to none.
validation	Madonna	Ricky	Plus, the acting was great, and Ricky██ is my idol and she did a phat job!
validation	Madonna	Miss Parker	After an energetic animated credits sequence--which is much more fun than the rest of the picture--we have nothing to look at but ███████'s black mascara and red lips set off by her platinum hair and pale complexion.
validation	Madhavi Sharma	Michael Madsen	I would recommend all to see the movie Michael Madsen is a journalist who covers those hip-shaking parties of Bollywood for the Page 3 of the newspaper
validation	Madeline L'Engle	Andy Goldsworthy	Well, it wasn't just me. Nearly every single one felt the same way--cheated out of the great story that Andy Goldsworthy had so skillfully created!
validation	Madeleine Stowe	Angela Bassett'	As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Angela Bassett' (whatever happened to her??) are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all.
validation	Madeleine L'Engle	Eddie Constantine	There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is Eddie Constantine!
validation	Madeleine Engle	Leopold Kessler	I really was crushed to see the same person Leopold Kessler that wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book, and a terrible film
validation	Madeleine	Bromwell	Bromwell█ is one of a number of costume dramas produced around the late 1940s to focus upon psychological conflicts from a female perspective.
validation	Maddy	Patrick	We not only discovered one of the worst movies out there, but also that it is a cult classic! It is filled w/plot holes and makes no sense. The actress who plays █████ is pretty, but that's about it.
validation	Maclean	Aaron Eckhart	None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because ███████ loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.
validation	Machaty	Mehta	It's simply to point out that a movie like Mehta██'s comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today.
validation	Mac Ahlberg	Jackie Chan	Decent special effects, moody lighting courtesy of prolific genre cinematographer Jackie Chan
validation	MAGNOLIA	Mr. Bip	I mean, let's face it, the acting is horrible (I mean: soap opera-level), the story has not one surprise (this has been done endless times before, connecting several storylines: SHORT CUTS, Mr. Bip█, PLAYING BY HEART, only much better), not one realistic character in it (some true freak-seeing along the way, notice the hilarious zombie-like daughter), and so on and so on. As if that's not enough, the film is 135 min.
validation	Lynch	Ricky	What I found very intriguing with MD, is that Ricky constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't.
validation	Lynch	Mehta	"It amazes me how anyone can call Mehta's garbage ""art"", but if beauty rests in the eye of the beholder, so be it."
validation	Lutz	Kate	In part 7, Kate was played by another woman
validation	Luke Skywalker	Rupert Everett	Rupert Everett, now a Jedi knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister!
validation	Luke Skywalker	Yasuaki Kurata	I liked how directly this sequel took off after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated the maturity of Yasuaki Kurata as a character(and also Mark Hamill, as an actor).
validation	Luke	Jane	I loved the duel between Vader and Jane which is the best of the saga.
validation	Luise Rainier	Peter Sellers	"Peter Sellers plays Olan. She does not even look Chinese! I think she tried to get the role, but they should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they didn't, and Ms. Rainier is very good in the film, but they hardly tried to make her look ""authentic"". Stillm its a great film, especially if you read the book (I did in high school, decades ago)."
validation	Luise Rainer	Aidan Quinn	The special effects and costumes are very good for the time period.I am surprised that Aidan Quinn█ received an Oscar for such a limiting role.
validation	Lugosi	Taylor	Taylor plays a character billed as The Scientist, but comes off more as an omnipotent puppet master.
validation	Lugosi	Brolin	Third - how the heck did Brolin get out of cabs without being seen?
validation	Lucy Lutz	Tim Curry	Detective Tim Curry of LAPD flies to England to bring him back to the US.
validation	Lucille Ball	Carmen Miranda	She is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film (I believe that ████████████ may have modeled her later career on Davies' style.
validation	Lovelace	Brosnan	"Linda Brosnan█ was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves ""civilized"" however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized."
validation	Louis Wollheim	Jeff Lieberman	Jeff Lieberman apparently never became a household name.
validation	Louis Sachar	Dev Anand	The story was written by Dev Anand███, yes, but it seems that this story is made for film, and Andrew Davis does a great job directing it.
validation	Louis Brooks	David Drach	Despite having someone else's voice dubbed over hers, this remains a stunning tour de force for David Drach█.

validation	Lola Albright	Boris Karloff	When Boris Karloff as her sister commits suicide over the whole affair, Evelyn's on a mission, get Korvin or die trying.
validation	Lois Smith	James Best	The top-notch cast includes Sally Kellerman as Foster's neurotic, insecure, peevish mother, Scott Baio as a sweet skateboarder dude, Randy Quaid as Kagan's rich older boyfriend, British 60's pop singer Adam Faith as Foster's feckless, absentee rock promoter father, and James Best as Kagan's smothering, overprotective mother.
validation	Lois Lane	Jane Fonda	With intrepid reporter █████████ as the only passenger on board,
validation	Lloyd Hughes	Deepa Mehta	She married Deepa Mehta█ in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children.
validation	Line Producer	Jason Connery	"Pandro S. Berman was ""In Charge of Production"" but that made him the so-called Jason Connery."
validation	Lindsey McKeon	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro is very cute and I'd like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script.
validation	Linda	Simon	"Simon Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves ""civilized"" however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized."

validation	Lilith	Madonna	Can't say the same for her co star ██████ with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system. Appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed.
validation	Lieve Schreiber's	Eddie Constantine	This is Eddie Constantine directorial debut and is well done.
validation	Libby	Nolte	My favourite episodes are the one where she turns Nolte into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series.
validation	Lewis Carroll's	Leopold Kessler	1st watched 2102010 4 out of 10DirWilliam Sterling Fair musical adaptation of Leopold Kessler book about the young girl mentioned in the title and her adventures.
validation	Leslie Caron	Tom Savini	Okay, so the plot is on shaky ground. Yeah, all right, so there are some randomly inserted song and/or dance sequences (for example: Adam's concert and Henri's stage act). And Tom Savini██ can't really, um, you know... act. But somehow, 'An American In Paris' manages to come through it all as a polished, first-rate musical--largely on the basis of Gene Kelly's incredible dancing talent and choreography.
validation	Les Bronzes	Alice	Don't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one. Alice does not a good film, make.
validation	Leopold	Eddie Murphy	The colonel soon enlists, or forces, ███████ to be a spy (without giving him a choice or chance to think about it) to see if the Werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains Soon, ███████ is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir-ish way, where everyone and everything is not what it seems.
validation	Leonardo Vetra	David Boreanaz	I am not giving any spoilers, except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way, how David Boreanaz was found is also different.

validation	Leo	Leo	Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Leo's uncle.
validation	Lennon	Sarah Jordan	Like ██████, he has gained success without a loss of identity.
validation	Lena Endre	Jim Carrey	The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring Some of the audience seemed to find it funny but I like more intelligent humor. There were several known Swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script Jim Carrey was good looking as always. I don't remember the original movie so I can't say if it's better or worse. If you enjoy movies like Sällskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at.
validation	Lemmon	Lena	If you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this film, you will be left with a fantastic comedy. As it is, I still found it to be a pretty good movie, which is no small feat considering the coma I was put in by the opening scenes. To put it mildly, this film has a dreary beginning that wasn't even remotely funny, or even upbeat. Once things get sillier, however, you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger fan of Lena██ and Matthau who wants to see their earlier work.
validation	Leconte	Mahler	"Writer-director Patrice takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. ""Teach me how to be likable"", art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be. Just as we hope the travesty is over, pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts, fast-forwarding from damage to disaster. Like François's treasured Greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. Mahler█'s only asset is Julie Gayet in the part of Coste's business partner Catherine, looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut."

validation	Lauen Montgomery	Janeane Garofalo	There are two hardcore stars in it, Janeane Garofalo and Venus.
validation	Lars von Trier	Jackie Mason	Jackie Mason██ shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. The back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters, and the focus of the conversation they are having.
validation	Lars von Trier	Jeff Lieberman	Jeff Lieberman creates a noir atmosphere of post-war Germany utterly captivating. You get absorbed into the dream and you're let go only at the end credits.
validation	Lars Von Trier	Debbie	Someone release this movie on DVD so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so-called films of the 1990's and see how vapid they were for the most part, and how DebbieDebbie██ tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece.
validation	Lars Von Trier	John Leguizamo	It could only happen in a dream It's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, I prefer John Leguizamo's later films (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots).

validation	Lady Chatterley's	Christopher Walken	Much of █████████████████ time is spent taking care of her invalid husband, socializing with her rich friends and family, and doing light chores around the house.
validation	LUC BESSON	Shakespeare	"Although compared with ""Mad Max"", this film is in a league of its own. Set in post apocalyptic Paris, this film is about man's struggle for survival, he has lost his ability to speak, and there is a remarkable shortage of women. CONGRATULATIONS ██████████!"
validation	L'Engle	Nakama	I really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas Nakama█ brought out in her novel
validation	Kyoko	Mehta	Mehta is a beautiful Japanese woman who has run to California to escape from a failed relationship in Japan.
validation	Kusturica	Heero Yuy	Foreign humor is awful in films (except Heero Yuy), stick with doing dramas!
validation	Kurtwood Smith	Ashton Kutcher	There are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set. That 70's Show is a great example. When the show came on the air, nobody really heard of Ashton Kutcher much less the adolescents played wonderfully.
validation	Kurt Russell	George Burns	If your show makes me long for the worst Trek show ever, you're in trouble. The film Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and George Burns, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score, and cool sci-fi ideas.
validation	Kurt Russel	Sean Connery	And you know what it worked ███████████ did what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was I recommend this movie
validation	Kurt Angle	Paul Reiser	██████████ did some really good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler out of the match.
validation	Kristine DeBell	Kristine DeBell	I thought the movie was great. I thought Kristine DeBell was GREAT and was glad to see her move on into some more interesting roles. I even overlook the fact that the print I have wasn't quite put back together correctly. But, who cares?
validation	Kristine	Kristine	But her starring role in Alice in Wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be, right on Kristine as the center of attention
validation	Kristen	Shrek	Surprisingly she does quite well, as Shrek██, a spoiled rich-b*tch who suddenly finds herself dirt-poor, but with a conniving streak, and a twist of fate, that will possibly change her fortunes back around.
validation	Kris Kristofferson	Christopher Walken	And if I have to watch another movie with Christopher Walken croaking one dimensionally through another movie, I will give up watching movies.
validation	Kotter	Brynner	████ as the male lead sex symbol.
validation	Kong	Jeremy Clarkson	This movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers, especially contemporary audiences. Nevertheless I enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down-to-earth charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could've been trite lines. The cinematography of Hong ████ from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie. All in all, a better than average romantic drama, 7/10.
validation	Knotts	Turner	Is Turner' character bisexual?
validation	Kitty Wildenbrück	Donald Sutherland	As little girls, Donald Sutherland and her sister Evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting: Legend has it that a fiendish Red Lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people.

validation	Kira Reed	Taylor	All Taylor███ fans MUST see this.
validation	Kinski	Mehta	Mehta█ is, once again, great, although he has only little screen time, and one scene, where he breaks up a fight, is probably the only good scene in this.
validation	Kieslowski	Richard Widmark	██████████ never ceases to amaze me.
validation	Kieslowski	Wes Craven	Nevertheless, the way Wes Craven presents their winding ways through life, their complicated interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or destiny, makes me understand faith, makes me (want to) believe in God.
validation	Kieslowski	Neil Simon	Most of Neil Simon 's films seem like puzzles to me, meant to expand mind and soul.
validation	Kevin Tenney	Martin Ritt	Dear friends, I've never seen such a trash movie as NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that the director Martin Ritt█ had the intention to copy classics like THE EVIL DEAD by Sam Raimi (1978) or George A.
validation	Kevin Costner's	Denise Richards	"Another film that I would draw comparisons to is Denise Richards ""Dragonfly""."

validation	Keira Knightley	Whoopi Goldberg	The real story of this film is the love of Whoopi Goldberg, at times it reminds of The Singing Detective, as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity.

validation	Keira Knightley	Billy Crystal	"I saw the movie because I'm a Billy Crystal██ fan and in that respect it was good, she brings a great performance as usual. Really there is nothing that I can say is bad about the acting or the movie in general other than it isn't my favorite kind of movie. In a phrase ""it was messed up"". If you like thrillers and mysteries then this is your kind of movie. It may seem a bit predictable at times, but it is well written and gives some unexpected turns. The movie takes place in a past tense with flashes of memory as everyone tries to figure out what happened, including the audience. If you ever get the chance to watch this movie it won't disappoint you, its a good way to pass the time. But if you don't ever watch it, you aren't missing much."
validation	Keiko	Vidor	Thus, Yamashita's failure to express his yearning for Vidor is set against Dojima's earlier lovemaking with her, and a fellow exconvict's attempted rape.
validation	Katie	Boyle	She also finds that their somehow connected to what her daughter, Boyle, is having now.
validation	Kathy Bates	Calvin	It started off well enough with Calvin█████'character having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered.
validation	Kathy Bates	Deepa Mehta	Before seeing this movie, I would've said that I loved everything Deepa Mehta has done
validation	Kathryn Bigelow	Jay Chou	I am a big fan of director Jay Chou███████ but I found this movie to be incredibly boring, slow, dull and a complete waste of time.
validation	Katharine Hepburn	Agustí Villaronga	by the way, Agustí Villaronga copied her comedy style and not the other way around (check your dates, guys).
validation	Kate	Jeff Smith	"SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is kicked out by the spinster, ████ (Andie McDowell), because she wrongly believes that Jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends. Kate thought she caught them en flagrante delicto. Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed reluctantly leaves, and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on. Then he gets run over (""Crushed"", one of the meaning of the title) by a truck. And dies. ""And then he gets run over by a truck."" Can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element? Up to then, its a comedy that intends to be frothy, but lacks any real fizz. Everybody but Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jed, and everybody's sad, until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive, instead of destructive. I give it 2 ugh's."
validation	Karate Kid	Cinderella	Now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first Cinderella, but I would recommend this one.
validation	Kansas	Sadako	"Saw the film at it's Lawrence, Sadako premiere. This wavering story about a group of disgruntled highschoolers killing off the competition for prom queen was just awful. It fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad script, no clear point. But mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves - ""Hey I have some money, so let's make a movie!"" - without really thinking it out. Sorrowfully most indie films that don't make it suffer from just that mentality. They just don't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie... or in this case, even a watchable one. With this film I do not feel ashamed to say, that if I didn't know some of the crew, I would have walked out. Simple as that."
validation	Kannathil Muthamittal	Christopher Walken	The Director of Christopher Walken███ directed the first Indian film I had seen Dil Se which led me down the path of buying well over 122 Hindi DVDs
validation	Kane Hodder	Brad Pitt	It's also worth noting as an early acting credit for Brad Pitt██ (as the vengeful spirit) that helped *him* land the gig
validation	Kane	Inman	This is the true story of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped... so watch what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real, this is exactly what happens -- minus the cameras planted at every minuscule corner of the house in Barcelona, Spain, where ████ comes to stay, having to learn Spanish to fill into his job requirements.

validation	Justin Kerrigan	Frank Sinatra	The movie was made on a miniscule budget and I look forward to future offerings of Writer/Director Frank Sinatra██ when his talent is discovered by the major movie makers.
validation	Juliette Binoche	Christopher Walken	Impressive how ████████████████ isn't aware of the film crew at the movie setI'll explain it's not,like,ignoring them technicians nor the Director, the folks in the film making process.

validation	Julie Delpy	Julie Delpy	"The primary reason to see ""Before Sunrise,"" is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines."
validation	Julie Andrews	David Boreanaz	"█████████████ gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the ""Whistling in the Dark"" production number"
validation	Julie	Simon	Simon's friends don't like him-he doesn't fit in, doesn't go to their school, doesn't have money.
validation	Julian Hernandez	Harry Beaumont	Again, as in Mil nubes de paz, Harry Beaumont██ directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it...
validation	Julia Roberts	Pearl Bailey's	There is a gay remake of Pretty Woman, with the █████████████ part taken by an Aussie tart with a heart.
validation	Jules Dassin	Harry Beaumont	Firslty, ███████████ directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film.
validation	Jules Dassin	Peter Boyle	American expatriate Peter Boyle█ makes an award-winning French gangster film.
validation	Jude Law	Dourif	This was a very funny movie, not Oscar-worthy, but definately the best dollar I've ever spent at Blockbuster! Rupert Penry Jones is a shining star, and very well might be the new Dourif██! So, if you're in the mood for a British Teen Flick- RENT IT!!
validation	Judd Nelson	Jackie Chan	Only because I like Jackie Chan, and he's the only good part about this sequal.
validation	Jud Nelson	Rob Reiner	Rob Reiner is an aspiring actor who becomes involved with a married couple who enjoy playing sadistic games on other people
validation	Josie Lawrence	Josie Lawrence	Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes.
validation	Josie	Mehta	Finally, in the school I grew up in, even though the average class had over 1000 students, we could have picked out a chump like Mehta as being a fraud and we would have singled her out of the crowd.
validation	Josh Flitter	Boris Karloff	And ████████████ as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.
validation	Joseph Mazzello	Whoopi Goldberg	Although flawed in it's view of homosexuals, this movie will shed light for the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies concerning AIDS. Despite the depressing subject matter, this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys, and will make you laugh as well as cry. Very well-acted by all, especially Whoopi Goldberg and Brad Renfro. The language is a little strong, though appropriate, and it's an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family. But remember to have the Kleenex ready!
validation	Joseph Goebbels	Leopold Kessler	Unarmed, unorganized, and leaderless, they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich.Leopold Kessler, the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, anxious to have that city racially cleansed, was also in charge of the nation's public morale.
validation	Joseph Cotton	Marleen Gorris	Joseph Cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he staggers through his cameo appearance.
validation	Joseph	Carlos	I look forward to seeing more of his work and well as more of Ms. Carlos .
validation	Josef Fares	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia sets a new standard in laughing at the police. Right from the start you start laughing and keep laughing until at least four fifth of the film.
validation	Josef Fares	Moore	"MooreMoore█ seems to have had a much too easy ride after ""Jalla, Jalla!"""
validation	Josef Fares	Paul LeMat	"Paul LeMat█ had a success (in Sweden) making ""Jalla, Jalla!"". That film was a little overestimated, but it put some humour into the immigration questions in Sweden, although still being serious."
validation	Josef Fares	Martin Ritt	this is two steps down for director Martin Ritt who tries hard to make this work but it just won't get off the ground.
validation	Jones	Peter	"Those prophetic words were spoken by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous Jennifer Peter (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. Beautiful Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially Jones (directed here by Henry King, who also did ""The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper."
validation	Jonathon Freeman	Alice	"Now come on this is a great movie. I don't know what people mean when they say the acting was bad. AliceAliceAlice█, Gilbert Gottfried, Jason Alexander, Dan Castellaneta and even Jim Cummings all did great jobs here. The songs were great. As much as I hate Iago being a ""good guy"" it was still a great movie. It was nothing like Aladdin but who cares? Not me and nobody should judge it because of Aladdin the first. I didn't care about the animation because it was good enough. You could still tell what was going on. You should all stop complaining and realize that this is a great movie. Some parts were rushed and some parts were pointless but they do make up for it. It was better than The King Of Thieves because the animation gets even worse. The Return Of Jafar is a great movie for all Aladdin fans ."
validation	Jonathan Silverman	Christopher Walken	This movie moves and inspire you, it's like you are one of the family. Just to see and witness life during the depression era, makes you feel humble and grateful. Christopher Walken delivered well, so convincing and very witty! A must see for Teens!
validation	Jon Voight	Paul Lukas	The acting is fantastic, especially from Paul Lukas, who plays Mr. Sir, a very evil character.
validation	Jon Fedele	Dan Duryea	This time, it is painfully obvious Morty is a man (actor Dan Duryea) in a fake looking suit.
validation	Jon Bon Jovi	Jackie Chan	"This is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. First off, the cast is superb. Not only does it have current stars, like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jackie Chan█, Ted Danson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second off, the story was quite good also. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in ""Half Baked"" it has a true, life lesson image like ""Traffic"". So watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see."
validation	Jon Bon Jovi	Charlotte	This delightful movie tells the story of buds. And it's incredible. You'll laugh, and you'll smile, and you'll laugh. It's really all about the laughs. When Charlotte███ is funny in a movie, it's a heck of a movie! 'nuff said. Now go watch it!
validation	Johnson	Wolheim	Wolheim, as Annie is at times annoying and over acted..you cannot convince yourself that she truly is Annie.
validation	Johnson	Mr. Bip	""" With only the exceptions mentioned, these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories. PS--Writer/director, Mr. Bip, definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes----with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones."
validation	Johnny	Chaplin	The script never condescends toward any character, not even the hapless ██████
validation	Johnnie	Leopold	Despite a tight narrative, Leopold To's Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture, with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved.
validation	John Williams	Dennis Hopper	It's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic Acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by Dennis Hopper.
validation	John Wesley Hardin	Roger Corman	Roger Corman██████ probably would have liked how it came out.
validation	John Wesley Hardin	Christopher Walken	I am a descendant of Christopher Walken, of whom this movie was made.
validation	John Thaw	Cinderella	The performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered █████████, who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the London bombing.
validation	John Speredakos	Donald Sutherland	This angers some of the locals--especially Otis (███████████████) and things slowly (VERY slowly) go wrong.I was expecting the worst when I started watching this.
validation	John Saxon	Tim Boggs	It seems like this is the only film that Tim Boggs█ ever directed, and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera.
validation	John Savage	Bela	Poor BelaBela███ had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie.
validation	John Rys-Daves	David Self	I am not sure how much David Self████ got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a ROTTEN movie.
validation	John Millius	Jules Verne	He hasn't quite achieved true greatness yet, but one day he may just break through.On the 99th anniversary of the Spanish American war and the most famous land battle of that brief said war, Jules Verne█ wrote and directed a stirring tribute to the First Volunteer Cavalry.
validation	John Milius	Henry Brommel	Writer/director ███████████ takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways.

validation	John McIntire	Bruce Willis	Although Stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, Winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader (Bruce Willis█, especially great) and outlaw Dan Duryea, who's even more despicable than usual.
validation	John Lynch	Chris Sarandon	If Jacqueline McKenzie and ██████████ weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is.
validation	John Lithgow	John Lithgow	"The first half hour of ""Homegrown"" was rather boring and not absorbing, but as the film progressed, so did my interest in the characters and the plot. Several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to. The story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern California. They witness the murder of the farm's owner, Malcolm (John Lithgow), and they take over the weed for their own. The three rather simple-minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest, while all of the time trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the movie had several faults and a slow beginning, it turned out to be worthwhile. 7/10 stars."
validation	John Lithgow	Jack Palance	The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and Jack Palance.
validation	John Lennon	Alastair Sim	His devotion to The Beatles and ███████████ is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels.
validation	John Kielty's	John Williams	Seriously engaging, intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best Mean, gripping, moody and captivating Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word for it see it yourself One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends Beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year John Williams debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film This is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years No car chases, but a film packed with hum our and emotion I first saw this film screened at the Edinburgh film festival in 2000 and am now delighted to be able to own a copy on DVD.
validation	John Huston	Aidan Quinn	horny Aidan Quinn,
validation	John Hughes	John Hughes	"Don't mistake this for another lame John Hughes clichéd high school flick such as ""The Breakfast Club""."
validation	John Hickam	Peter Boyle	I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly. I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me. He gave off a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (Peter Boyle). I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
validation	John Gilbert	Deniz Akkaya	"Other stars who pop up in ""Show People"" are Deniz Akkaya, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle, and many others. Davies was adorable and a lively comedienne."
validation	John Ford	John Ford	My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest.
validation	John Denver	Eric Williams	As a Fan of ███████████ and of the Muppets, a DVD of this show would really be a good seller.
validation	John Corbett	Denise Richards	Denise Richards is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.
validation	John Corbett	Kelly Preston	I find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence rendered immediately in the courtroom, even after such a heartfelt speech by the brother (gorgeous ████████████), but overall the story was very gripping
validation	John Cleese	Patrick McGaw	███████████ make the movie very, very funny. A decent sense of humor is all one needs to laugh from beginning to end.
validation	John Cleese	John Woo	"I'm not a John Woo███ completist (although I thought ""Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I am a fan, and when I saw this sitting, neglected, on a shelf at my local Blockbuster, I decided to give it a try. What I got was a wonderful surprise, and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences I've ever had. The writing is typical English ""goon show"" schtick."
validation	John Carpenter's	Hopalong Cassidy	"Hm...but not if the sponsors saw ""Hopalong Cassidy Vampires""."
validation	John Candy	Madeleine	ARMED AND DANGEROUS is not one of the greats of Madeleine█.
validation	John	Jack	"You looking for a comic drama with suspense and an ensemble cast? Well locate this little sleeper. Jack Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are great in this little plot twister. Don't forget the cameo by Jamie Lee Curtis. A touch of the 60's, a touch of ""the Prince and the Pauper"", and dash of that homegrown gold makes for a greast little story."
validation	Joey	Mary	Mary is good natured and is always in a good mood.
validation	Joey	Lang	This leads to Lang hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip.
validation	Joey	Boyd	This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Boyd and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip.
validation	Joey	Iris	"In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for the ""perfect guy"" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Iris, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... ENJOY FRIENDS!"
validation	Joe Pesci	matthew Rhys	THE DEATH COLLECTOR is truly a wonderful film. Labeled as a MEAN STREETS ripoff, it has some really great stuff in it. A lot of the stuff in this movie would later be used by Scorsese himself, including the actors - █████████, Frank Vincent, etc.
validation	Joe Magtena	Anthony Wong	I'm surprised that ███████████ even made it.
validation	Joe Estevez	Brosnan	Brosnan████ may not have his brothers career, but does a good job of bringing focus to the story
validation	Joe Dallesandro	Denise Richards	Denise Richards is outstanding as the easy-going, passive, laid-back young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the talking while he listens with a faraway look in his eyes.
validation	Joe Dallesandro	Denise Richards	Denise Richards is outstanding as the easy-going, passive, laid-back young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the talking while he listens with a faraway look in his eyes.
validation	Joe Dallesandro	Terrence Winter	"Technically abominable (with audible ""pops"" between scenes)and awesomely amateurish, ""Flesh"" requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogue rings amazingly true and Terrence Winter, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives an utterly convincing performance."
validation	Joe	Ben	Ben stark naked is crouching on the floor feeding crumbs of cake to his little baby.
validation	Joe	Alan	One thing is certain, ███ is uninhibited when it comes to disrobing for sex or posing for an artist.
validation	Joe	Leo	It's a preliminary to another occasion when Leo divests himself of his clothes and poses as the discus thrower in true classical style.
validation	Joe	Ali	Despite all its technical short-comings, this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of Ali, a hustler, determined to earn $200 for his wife's pregnant girl friend.
validation	Joe	Jesse Franco	At the end of the film we gain the impression that we have got to know ███ pretty well.
validation	Joe	Leo	Another scene of amusing interest is the one in which Leo desperately seeks a loan of $100 from a gym friend, coming to the point of asking in a very circuitous approach.
validation	Jimmy Stewart	Louis Wolheim	Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, and Louis Wolheim and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do.  But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town?  Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West. Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.
validation	Jim Thompson	John Hazlett	The first of two John Hazlett adaptations released in 1990 (the other being the more well-known GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all of Thompson's hallmarks: dangerous women, the confidence game, and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being, or not as harmless. Jason Patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story) and the too-little-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a great performance. But Bruce Dern is the film's secret weapon: his sweet-talking grifter Uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes. there's almost no comic relief in this film, so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void.
validation	Jim Larson's	Eddie Murphy	"Eddie Murphy comments about it being a ""sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths"" were dead on Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie."
validation	Jim Cummings	Dourif	"Now come on this is a great movie. I don't know what people mean when they say the acting was bad. Jonathon Freeman, Gilbert Gottfried, Jason Alexander, Dan Castellaneta and even DourifDourif all did great jobs here. The songs were great. As much as I hate Iago being a ""good guy"" it was still a great movie. It was nothing like Aladdin but who cares? Not me and nobody should judge it because of Aladdin the first. I didn't care about the animation because it was good enough. You could still tell what was going on. You should all stop complaining and realize that this is a great movie. Some parts were rushed and some parts were pointless but they do make up for it. It was better than The King Of Thieves because the animation gets even worse. The Return Of Jafar is a great movie for all Aladdin fans ."
validation	Jim Carrey	John Woo	at least not a 'John Woo██ type' one what kept we watching was the characters
validation	Jim Carrey	Suzy Amis	Adam Sandler was great and Jack Nicholson was his usual crazy self. This funny, out of character Adam Sandler vehicle was bumpy at best, with a rather insulting Buddhist monk scene and some unintentionally dumb sequences as well as some overly obvious cameos which made the movie campy though tolerably cute. This feel good, though somewhat over the top anger solves anger philosophy ends up with a small twist and a satisfying conclusion. It was nice to see Adam Sandler can act. Both Sandler and Suzy Amis█ are gaining a lot of respect from me lately. Different, diversionary, insipid in places, but a pleasant romantic comedy. Seven out of ten stars.
validation	Jim Carey	Martin Ritt	The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance █████████ is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides
validation	Jim Beam	Yayoi Watanabe	One of the longest 80 minutes of my life I trooped it out though with the help of my old friend ████████.
validation	Jia Hongsheng	Jia Hongsheng	I found the Jia Hongsheng story interesting.
validation	Jessica Cauffiel	Leslie Howard	Leslie Howard███ gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in Urban Legend
validation	Jesse James	Cosi Fabian	For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Cosi Fabian, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
validation	Jerry Lundergaard	John Albasiny	The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his John Albasiny████ role from Fargo
validation	Jeremy Northam	Molly Ringwald	While she is sunning on the beach, a terrific looking gentleman named Jack (Molly Ringwald) makes overtures to her.
validation	Jeremy Irons	Eddie Murphy	"Worst. Movie. Ever. I can't believe they had to hire Eddie Murphy to give this piece of crap some credibility - and still failed. Did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own? (probably). ""Hey, let's make lots of things explode and give Mina big boobs, and have her speak in an adorably fake broken English. That'll make the morons watch."" ""But sir, that's not how the book went at all, I think we're mot being faithful to Mr. Wells' message."" ""F*ck it, we're going to the box office here, never mind some dead author's ideas on human nature. Also, let's add in Orlando Jones with some classic 'Black attitude' as a supporting character, and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book - Guy Pierce has to get some p*ssy at the end."""
validation	Jeremy Clarkson	Jeremy Clarkson	"I have to say that sometimes ""looks"" are all that matters, just like Jeremy Clarkson from BBC has pointed out (not about our earth though, but he is right anyway)."
validation	Jennifer McAllister	Jennifer McAllister	I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. It's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. But where do i find it? How can i download it?
validation	Jennifer Lopez	David Boreanaz	I don't really enjoy David Boreanaz.
validation	Jennifer Jones	Walter Matthau	"Those prophetic words were spoken by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous Walter Matthau (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. Beautiful Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially Jones (directed here by Henry King, who also did ""The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper."
validation	Jennifer Connelly	Linda Fiorentino	Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube, and Linda Fiorentino█.
validation	Jenna Jameson	Carl Brashear	because it is a fantasy adventure.The production values are high and the acting is(believe it or not) pretty good,especially Carl Brashear
validation	Jekyll and Hyde	William Haines	At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, William Haines█ is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times
validation	Jeffrey DeMunn	bridget fonda	"Citizen X tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed ""The Rostov Ripper"" This great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer. The film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over 12 years. (Possibly over 50 victims, mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as the lead detective and Donald Sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb. bridget fonda█ as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case. This a film not to be missed. It debuted I believe on HBO and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding. Great film"
validation	Jeffrey Dahmer	Howard Hughes	Let's filter the more judgmental..Ok, are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Howard Hughes ?
validation	Jeffrey Dahmer	Mark Piznarski	"Basically, ""The Secret Life: Mark Piznarski"" is just one sequence repeated over and over again."
validation	Jeffrey Combs	Bromwell High	Is there any question that Bromwell High is one of the true horror greats?
validation	Jeff Bennett	Ioan Gruffudd	While I don't like ████████████ as the dogcatcher, he is very good as Tramp.
validation	Jeff	Emma	Without the Emma character to act with on screen, the other actors just stop the movie, sit around and wait for him to return.
validation	Jed	Sita	"SPOILER: The young lover, ███, is kicked out by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she wrongly believes that Jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends. Kate thought she caught them en flagrante delicto. Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed reluctantly leaves, and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on. Then he gets run over (""Crushed"", one of the meaning of the title) by a truck. And dies. ""And then he gets run over by a truck."" Can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element? Up to then, its a comedy that intends to be frothy, but lacks any real fizz. Everybody but Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jed, and everybody's sad, until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive, instead of destructive. I give it 2 ugh's."
validation	Jean-Marc Barr	Paul Guilfoyle	Paul Guilfoyle plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the US Army during the war, arrives in Frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the Zentropa Railway.
validation	Jean Simmons	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy is adorable as usual.
validation	Jean	Jane	This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jane, who has fallen in love with Skip.
validation	Jay Leno	Peter Falk	Well no, I tell a lie, this is in fact not the best movie of all time, but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody I know has seen.  It's a buddy cop movie starring ████████ and Pat Morita(Mr Miyagi) with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something, but that doesn't matter.
validation	Jay Baruchel	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy is really been sort of a supporting guy in most of his movies
validation	Jay Adams	von Trier	The ultimate fates of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking, with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat von Trier rating as the saddest and most tragic He blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail.
validation	Jay	Mia	I will admit that I didn't check this out because of Mia
validation	Jason Voorhees	Ashton Kutcher	"playing Ashton Kutcher in the ""Friday the 13th"" series."
validation	Jason Shepherd	Jules Verne	"A 14-year old boy Jules Verne██ wrote an English paper called ""Big Fat Liar""."
validation	Jason Lee	Ashton Kutcher	█████████ can be hilarious, and he gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat.
validation	Jason Bourne	Deepa Mehta	To say it resembles the first Deepa Mehta█ film, only set in the sci-fi genre, isn't cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities; despite them both being released in the same year.
validation	Jason Bourne	matthew Rhys	"The Bourne Ultimatum - matthew Rhys (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the newest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the CIA's latest program ""Blackbriar"" to make super assassins like himself. I was so psyched for this one that I watched it's predecessors yesterday and today."
validation	Jason Alexander	Richard Dreyfuss	"Now come on this is a great movie. I don't know what people mean when they say the acting was bad. Jonathon Freeman, Gilbert Gottfried, ███████████████, Dan Castellaneta and even Jim Cummings all did great jobs here. The songs were great. As much as I hate Iago being a ""good guy"" it was still a great movie. It was nothing like Aladdin but who cares? Not me and nobody should judge it because of Aladdin the first.

The Return Of Jafar is a great movie for all Aladdin fans ."
validation	Jason	Kirsten	Skip this film and re-watch another Freddy or █████ flick and you'll be way more content.
validation	Jason	Stang	But I it wasn't just action in this film, Stang doesn't just kill and run.
validation	Japp  All	Sita	the stuff about Sita having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time.
validation	Janine Turner	Melvin Douglas	The film looks great and there is great support from █████████████, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow.
validation	Janet McTeer	John Batchelor	The lead performance from ████████████ as Pru Sarn is simply brilliant, guts and genuine emotion go hand in hand as McTeer gives it her all.
validation	Janet McTeer	Roy Scheider	I had also hoped with the Oscar won by Roy Scheider and the huge popularity of Clive Owen the BBC would naturally get this fine production on DVD...I cannot believe all these years later we still have no DVD.
validation	Jane Jansens	John Waters	The story of John Waters█ battle with cancer and Dan Jansen love for his sister.
validation	Jane Austen	Aidan Quinn	The detective, unlike the anxious, prejudiceridden private eyes, are simply there to be brilliant, and maybe a little eccentric.The problem with most films from Golden Age books is that they try to be period recreations of the Merchant IvoryAidan Quinn school, and end up looking silly.
validation	Jane	Iris	Plain Iris, but maybe the director was dating her or something.
validation	Jane	Sita	And for a woman like Sita, who never presumed to have *any* love come her way, it is a minor miracle.
validation	Jamie Lee Curtis	Lewis Milestone	"You looking for a comic drama with suspense and an ensemble cast? Well locate this little sleeper. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are great in this little plot twister. Don't forget the cameo by Lewis Milestone█. A touch of the 60's, a touch of ""the Prince and the Pauper"", and dash of that homegrown gold makes for a greast little story."
validation	Jamie Lee Curtis	Linda Fiorentino	"This is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. First off, the cast is superb. Not only does it have current stars, like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson, and Linda Fiorentino. Second off, the story was quite good also. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in ""Half Baked"" it has a true, life lesson image like ""Traffic"". So watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see."
validation	Jamie Lee Curtis	Dostoyevsky	If it wasn't meant to be a comedy, the filmmakers sure goofed. If they intended for it to be a comedy, they hit the mark. Our critic says Homegrown is a wonderful film filled with family values and community spirit, recommends it for all audiences, and says that he really liked Dostoyevsky█████'s performance. It deserves a theatrical re-release.
validation	Jamie Cromwell	William H. Macy	Great supporting cast, especially ██████████████ as the extortionist private eye
validation	Jamie	Simon	Simon Foxx is my favorite comedian.
validation	Jamie	Eddie	If it wasn't meant to be a comedy, the filmmakers sure goofed. If they intended for it to be a comedy, they hit the mark.

It deserves a theatrical re-release.
validation	James Woods	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia is pathetic...not his character, his acting
validation	James Woods	Robert Evans	The over-acted performance by ███████████ as the cop-dad who can't make up his mind if he feels selfish, compassionate, caring or heartless towards his good-girl gone bad, socially inept and unparented daughter was the kick that booted me out of the theater about 1h20m into the film.
validation	James Woods	Bebe Neuwirth	"Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see ███████████ in all his dangly male ""look-at-me, I'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man"" glory"
validation	James Whitmore	Dvid Trainer	The uncivilized Mature lusts for the colonel's wife, giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man's wife at one point by Dvid Trainer██ who plays Mature's older and wiser mountain man father figure.
validation	James Stewart	Barbara Sukowa	The main character, Lin Macadam, played by █████████████, represents justice and righteousness.
validation	James Stewart	Barbara Sukowa	The main character, Lin Macadam, played by █████████████, represents justice and righteousness.
validation	James Stewart	Marjorie Main	The larger-than-life figures of Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, and the specters of George Armstrong Custer and Sitting Bull, loom over director Anthony Mann's hugely entertaining first western with Marjorie Main.
validation	James Spader	Danny Glover	With one of my very favorite actors, Danny Glover, I expected this film to be at least tolerable.
validation	James Eaves	Steve Carell	███████████ has created something that feels much bigger
validation	James Earl Jones	Angie Dickinson	3P0, R2, and Chewie do their roles to a T while Angie Dickinson█ still is cinema's greatest villain: Darth Vader.
validation	James Cagney	Schrader	This is what Schrader████ is all about, wisecracks, cockiness, hard as nails and no-nonsense charisma.
validation	James Caan	Aidan Quinn	It's also kind of a shame that ██████████ went on to be typecast as the 'tough guy' for the rest of his career, because this film evidenced that he is capable of so much more than that.
validation	James Brown	Eric Williams	The best impression was of ███████████ and Mr T> SO FUNNY!!
validation	James Bond	Cinderella	However, it's this spoof of all spy and psychedelic series Cinderella, the Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the Monkees among others which makes this series worth to watch.
validation	James	Alice	This movie was horrible and corny. Alice Agee is rolling in his grave.This movie was nothing at all like the book and made a mockery of it. No one should see this movie unless they want to gag.
validation	Jake Gyllenhaal	Richard Widmark	I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly. I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast. Richard Widmark as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me. He gave off a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
validation	Jacqueline McKenzie	Christopher Walken	If Christopher Walken█ and John Lynch weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is.
validation	Jackie Cooper	Kelly Preston	Kelly Preston was the top child actor at MGM in the early 30s when it was the top studio.
validation	Jackie Chan	Aidan Quinn	I normally love Aidan Quinn movies but this one was terrible.
validation	Jackie Burkhardt	Martin Niemoller	Martin Niemoller, the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around, spoiled kid of a rich father, and, of course, cheerleader.
validation	Jackie	Gamera	I've only seen one Gamera film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into Hollywood films that didn't turn out so well.
validation	Jack Nicholson	Doon Mackichan	The lead Martian's Doon Mackichan take-off is side-splitting.
validation	Jack Lemmon	Spielberg	Tension and neurotic persona are brilliantly played out by Spielberg██'s.
validation	Jack Lemmon	Oliver Stone	In re-watching it again last night, I once again marvel at the genius that was ███████████.
validation	Jack Klugman	Aidan Quinn	"Like most people I will always feel that Aidan Quinn█ and Tony Randall are the definitive ""Odd Couple"". Their incredible work on the TV series from the early to mid-70s was a highwater mark for television at the time... easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale."
validation	Jack Grinnage	Mickey Rourke	Kolchak is sheer entertainment. Great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him. Simon Oakland, Mickey Rourke and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having.
validation	Jack Bauer	Leonard Maltin	And ██████████ is one of the greatest protagonists in a TV series in a long time.
validation	Jack Arnold	Carlos Saura	Being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as ███████████'s No Name on the Bullet, and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.

validation	Jack	Anne	Anne Oakie has a great, Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini look-alike (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Chaplin's Hitler character, Adenoid Hynkel, a lot of fits.
validation	Jack	Anne	"Anne London's short story ""A Thousand Deaths"""" is virtually unrecognizable in this sluggish cinematic translation."
validation	JESSICA	Brosnan	Brosnan: A GHOST STORY is as the name implies a ghost story. The theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy! A woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead.
validation	J. Varhola	Pollard	Michael Pollard███, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine This movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, watching as the RAWANDAN genocide un-furls around him.
validation	Izzard	Sadako	This is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows I've ever seen. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I missed half the jokes. This showcases Sadako as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is.
validation	Ito Misaki	Jim Brown	Soon, it seems that a lot of countries are reluctant to accept any more due to the sudden influx of Japanese in their country and the chaos that follows (if this ever happens, touch-wood, I hope Jim Brown█ will be safe... she can always stay at my place... hee hee).

validation	Hugo Weaving	Bebe Neuwirth	It was a riot to see ████████████ play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).
validation	Huckleberry Finn	Hopalong Cassidy	"Junior high and high school teachers will find ""The Cure"" an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to ""Hopalong Cassidy"" or as a stand-alone lesson. Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme, the strong sup-text of friendship and love, as they evolve between Eric and Dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also suggest directed class discussion about how Eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend."
validation	Hubert de Montille	Christopher Walken	First of all, this movie, as a world tour of wine making, let the spectator enjoy beautiful places, the people interviewed are really interesting and funny too, in particular Christopher Walken.

validation	Homegrown	Ellen Page	If it wasn't meant to be a comedy, the filmmakers sure goofed. If they intended for it to be a comedy, they hit the mark. Our critic says █████████ is a wonderful film filled with family values and community spirit, recommends it for all audiences, and says that he really liked Jamie Lee Curtis's performance. It deserves a theatrical re-release.
validation	Holmes	Sadako	Playing a high strung, distracted artistic type a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical Sherlock Sadako, Rathbone's character looks like he couldn't find his way out of bed without help.

validation	Hollywood	Von Trier	Despite Von Trier's dialogue myopia, cinema is not about dialogue, nor is it about beautiful lighting, action or music.
validation	Hogan	Saura	You could clearly see Saura had a black eye.
validation	Hitchcock	Hartley	I suspect he is familiar with Hartley██'s Foreign Correspondent in which devious Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several Welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does. All von Trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies.
validation	Hillerman	John Woo	This film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc-buster violent thriller/mystery/murder movies that abound. It is about real people making the best of their lives. They just happen to be Indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. The realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot. The sound track is by BC Smith, who also did the soundtrack for Coyote Waits, and is great. Adam Beach plays a tribal policeman who is a little bit accident prone and Wes Studi is the stoic consummately professional detective. There are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. We have also seen Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a John Woo█ novel, and we greatly enjoyed it too.

validation	Herman	spacek	spacek has made northern drama his own with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula falters in this ropey, flat and contrived tale of two teenage delinquents trying to get season tickets to see Newcastle.
validation	Herman	Altman	I am all for entertainment, and Altman's track record shows he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughs and tears.
validation	Hepburn	Jackie Mason	███████ shows us in carefully lit close-ups how to demonstrate fear, love, anxiety, giddiness, happiness, doubt, suspicion and terror.
validation	Henry Winkler	Oprah Winfrey	The candidate for worst movie is likely Oprah Winfrey, even though he is good, he can't keep this from being a likely candidate for worst movie of the year 2000.
validation	Henry Winkler	Anthony Quinn	I saw the film twice in the space of one week, both times the at a cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was packed both times and people had to be turned away. From the start of the film with Anthony Quinn getting 'injured' on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter, laughter that lasted until the credits. For those who love American wrestling this film is a must, but be ready to see Henry Winkler as you have never seen him before. Also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head-but! If you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best!
validation	Henry Thomas	Ben Affleck	The only redeeming feature is Ben Affleck█, who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess
validation	Henry King	Dev Anand	"Those prophetic words were spoken by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous Jennifer Jones (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. Beautiful Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially Jones (directed here by Dev Anand█, who also did ""The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper."
validation	Henry Brown	Henry Brown	His brother, who operates under the persona of Dutch Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father.
validation	Henry Brandon	Tashan	Another must have film TashanTashan█ is a favorite! I was so surprised when I learned years ago that he was from Germany because he sounds & looks so typically American! And wasn't he great in The Searchers as Chief Scar??!! Another of my favorites, I have it & watch it over & again Now if I could add this one to my collection, it would make my day! This is a great wildlife story & film for all ages The scenery is so absolutely beautiful & the plight of the endangered snow leopards is told with such great emotion it will spark the interest in endangered species in anyone, especially children If I could I would give a copy to all of my grands & great grands!

validation	Helen Mirren	Jackie Chan	It is basically a bland teen comedy that I only watched because I like Jackie Chan█, who is in fact very good as an impossibly cruel teacher.
validation	Helen Huntingdon	Richard Dreyfuss	Emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily, mental, societal  her heroine, Richard Dreyfuss, escapes a miserable marriage, flees brutality and alcoholism, braves not only her abusive husband's fury, but society's pinched intolerance and malicious gossip, to wreak change in her life.

validation	Heavy Metal	Eric Williams	Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a film revolves around the 80's culture of ███████████ and horror movies--two things which I love dearly.
validation	Heath Ledger	Theodore Rex	I have seen the trailer for this movie several times over, and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes away from it (it got my attention for sure). Theodore Rex sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom ,who is seen for a split second looks fantastic. I think that this movie will be a hit, and will be seen over and over again my many people.
validation	Hearn	Simon	Simon's performance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since I first saw him perform the piece on Broadway and later in the film.

validation	Harry Potter	Ringu	Some great examples are the RinguRingu██ series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney film ever made
validation	Harry Langdon	Max von Sydow	He's at his best here, and the show is really Max von Sydow's curious magic and ability to spin comedy out of almost nothing.
validation	Harry	Mehta	Here the comedy is not in Mehta's big reactions to the danger of sitting perched between two moving cars, but in his slowness to take it in.
validation	Harriet Craig	Oprah Winfrey	A controlling housewife, Oprah Winfrey, she controls all of her husband's life, who you may also recognize as the long suffering husband.
validation	Harlequin	Dourif	One doesn't expect much from a Lifetime movie, especially one this old, but this is nearly unwatchably bad. Plot-wise, it's a dreadful, clichÃ©d romance of a type even Dourif███ would consider beneath them.
validation	Harilal Gandhi	Ashton Kutcher	Keeping all political views aside, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's 'Gandhi, My Father' is a good movie that cleverly explores the confused-towards-family side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and the fight of his eldest son Ashton Kutcher with the society, his larger-than-life father, and most importantly demons in his head.
validation	Hardy	Altman	This was Laurel and █████'s last silent film for Roach Studios.
validation	Harald Zwart	Bruce Willis	I am a huge fan of Bruce Willis, and I just knew that I had to see this movie
validation	Hans Zimmer	Bob Balaban	An extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by Bryan Adams and Bob Balaban.
validation	Hanks	Julia	Julia was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.
validation	Hanks	Julia	The good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement Julia was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.
validation	Han Solo	Darth Vader	Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi knight, returns from Tatooine with ████████ and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister!
validation	Han	Lin	Leia is still cool in this film as well as Lin and Lando.
validation	Hammerstein	Mahler	This progression should amply illustrate the degeneration of the script's attitude from Mahler█████'s condescending liberalism to MGM's stereotyped racism.All surface and no substance to this pallid MGM musical product.
validation	Hamlet	Taylor	Taylor OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form.
validation	Hamlet	Sticky Fingers	This is coming from someone who said ██████ was good (The Ethan Hawke Version?)
validation	Halfdan Hussey's	Beverly D'Angelo	The one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is Beverly D'Angelo innovative visual effects However, as eye-catching as they may be, they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above
validation	Half Baked	Lisa Kudrow	"This is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. First off, the cast is superb. Not only does it have current stars, like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second off, the story was quite good also. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in ""██████████"" it has a true, life lesson image like ""Traffic"". So watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see."
validation	Hal Hartley	Jim Brown	Fans of Jim Brown██ will not be disappointed!!
validation	Guy Pierce	Aidan Quinn	"Worst. Movie. Ever. I can't believe they had to hire Jeremy Irons to give this piece of crap some credibility - and still failed. Did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own? (probably). ""Hey, let's make lots of things explode and give Mina big boobs, and have her speak in an adorably fake broken English. That'll make the morons watch."" ""But sir, that's not how the book went at all, I think we're mot being faithful to Mr. Wells' message."" ""F*ck it, we're going to the box office here, never mind some dead author's ideas on human nature. Also, let's add in Orlando Jones with some classic 'Black attitude' as a supporting character, and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book - ██████████ has to get some p*ssy at the end."""
validation	Guy Kibbee	Guy Kibbee	Besides those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is at his flustered best here.7 out of 10
validation	Gunga Din	Eric Williams	"I saw this picture in 1940 for $.11 and I would like to secure a DVD in 2006 The film was the greatest adventure of the time and,like all epics,is still an entertainment marvel (B&W and all)You get a sense of real bonded friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of Sam Jaffe & Eduardo Cianelli are outstanding (This could not be done today I particularly liked the ending where the colonel recites the end of Kipling's poem over the body of █████████ and tells the ""Untouchable"" ""You're a better man than I am Gunga Din""They don't make movies of this character today. The only cast member that is still alive today is Joan Fontaine"
validation	Gruner	Sadako	"And I am now suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome. This movie was horrible. It was boring, unrealistic, and the acting was dreadful. The best part of the movie was the end credits because that signaled the end of my torture. Watching Gruner play the nice guy with moves of death and a heart of gold is wearing out its welcome. If I hear him say,"" I don't want to fight"" one more time I will scream in frustration. He has potential, but he is picking the wrong scripts. There were so many things in this movie I could nitpick, I would be typing for days. The worst would be Sadako blatantly plugging his own line of athletic gear. Then there is the gratuitous nudity, the requisite nosy reporter, and the bad guy wearing black. Skip this or suffer like I did."
validation	Griffin Dunne	Peter Sellers	Peter Sellers plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot.
validation	Gretchen Moll	Alpha Video	South who's momma wouldn't let her date until she married, who moved to New York and ended up becoming the most successful pin-up of her age, is driven by an outstanding performance from Alpha Video██.
validation	Gregory	Boorman	First, there is very little of Ms. Boorman's book in this script.
validation	Greg Kinnear	Danny Glover	The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and the crisp cinematography of David Tattersall enhances everything.THE MATADOR (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Danny Glover, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker.
validation	Grayson	Jovovich	When ███████ sings the same songs it's hard to believe she's not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting.
validation	Granted Murphy	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro has had plenty of recent adult oriented flops such as Show time and I Spy but his reputation as a family film star has been remarkable including his most recent hit, Daddy Daycare.
validation	Graham Greene	Nayakan	Good old black and white Nayakan██████ based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things
validation	Grace Pat Adam	Borden Chase	With all the food available in the swamp and rivers that he inhabited the crocodile was only after the quartet, Borden Chase██ & Jimmy, for invading his watery domain that he felt was the grand ruler of.
validation	Grace Hartman	Dylan O'Leary	Dylan O'Leary, who died of cancer at age 48, did almost no film work, so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up, to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform.
validation	Grace Elliot	Grace Elliot	Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution.

validation	Goldie Hawn	Billy Crystal	Unless you are a ███████████ fan don't go out of your way to see this film.
validation	Goldie Hawn	John Waters	The only good thing about this movie was the shot of John Waters standing.
validation	Goldberg	Gabin	Aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either, Gabin███ gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast.
validation	Godard	Bock	But then the story went on, puzzling and gripping, beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see Bock██ do if he weren't so occupied with spreading his political messages.
validation	Glover	Lena	Somehow the teaming of Lena██ and Short didn't mix. There was not the special chemistry that is required to make this work. The premise was a great idea but it seemed so forced most of the time. The silly grin that Short kept though out the film, really made his charactor even dumber than it was suppose to be. Maybe I just was looking for something clever and witty. This wasn't it.
validation	Glenn Corbett	George A. Romero	An excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone. I liked this movie because █████████████ also appeared in Star Trek as Zeffrem Cochrane in 1967. I also liked it because I am a fan of the apollo space program.
validation	Glenn Close	Aiden Quinn	Excellent story of lives that need repair....one of those rare films that I could watch with my 7 and 8 year old daughters... Aiden Quinn was excellent in the title role. It was also nice to see Christopher Walken in a more normal role.
validation	Giulia Boschi	Max von Sydow	The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but it is so much more than that. Anyone growing up in the South would experience the same things. A longing for another, one of a different race, that cannot be consummated. Even a glance is forbidden. There are no words needed. Their facial expressions say everything. It is the story of a black servant, Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Max von Sydow).
validation	Giovanni Bocaccio's	David Attenborough	Though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments, it is a definitely incorrect assumption This is an adaptation of 9 SEEMINGLY unrelated stories from David Attenborough█ 14th century Decameron story collection. Set within a medieval Italian town's largely peasant population, it is a diatribe on the reality of sex (and its consequences) within that world and time A realistic view of Life within this world, it sometimes feels like a journey back in time. Given the depicted human element of its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of Life, at times Or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the Catholic Church's rules. Nothing terribly special, but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions.
validation	Gilbert Markham	Sonia Braga	"And Sonia Braga████ was amazingly ""on it"" from the very start of the movie."
validation	Gilbert Gottfried	Richard Dreyfuss	"Now come on this is a great movie. I don't know what people mean when they say the acting was bad. Jonathon Freeman, Richard Dreyfuss█, Jason Alexander, Dan Castellaneta and even Jim Cummings all did great jobs here. The songs were great. As much as I hate Iago being a ""good guy"" it was still a great movie. It was nothing like Aladdin but who cares? Not me and nobody should judge it because of Aladdin the first. I didn't care about the animation because it was good enough. You could still tell what was going on. You should all stop complaining and realize that this is a great movie. Some parts were rushed and some parts were pointless but they do make up for it. It was better than The King Of Thieves because the animation gets even worse. The Return Of Jafar is a great movie for all Aladdin fans ."

validation	George W. Bush	John Hughes	Lion's Gate completely deceives on this bombshell... No...this is a disaster. After watching this film, you would swear John Hughes███ had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic. Stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time.
validation	George Stevens	Robin Williams	"However the continual forays into comedy  such as the spiked punch routine  make this ""slow"" portion bearable.Producer-director Robin Williams was a natural when it came to this sort of thing, himself having cut his teeth at the Hal Roach studios, and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point."
validation	George Sanders	Walter Matthau	Pidgeon is pursued back to England by the evil Walter Matthau and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified.
validation	George Romero's	Leopold Kessler	Before the release of Leopold Kessler genre-defining Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures
validation	George Romero	Joan Crawford	Updated remake of Joan Crawford's 1968 classic, has better makeup and special effects than it's predecessor.
validation	George Peppard	Nancy Marchand	Nancy Marchand steals the movie as a gambler who doesn't want any trouble until situation becomes impossible.
validation	George Peppard	Pierce Brosnan	In steps Pierce Brosnan, playing a former deputy, who comes to town and eventually gets caught up in things when his better sense tells him that he shouldn't stay.
validation	George Orwell	Dennis Hopper	But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by Dennis Hopper.
validation	George Lucas	Stephen King	I know many true Star Wars fans hated Stephen King for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity.
validation	George Hilton	Richard Widmark	█████████████ never really grabs me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood
validation	George Hilton	Max von Sydow	There are plenty of suspects, including a tenacious investigator (Max von Sydow) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover
validation	George C. Scott	Oliver Cromwell	Don't get me wrong, Oliver Cromwell was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly.
validation	George Brent	Bruce Willis	"""Baby Face"" is a precode melodrama starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck, an almost unrecognizable Bruce Willis, and Theresa Harris."
validation	George Armstrong Custer	Eric Williams	The larger-than-life figures of Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, and the specters of Eric Williams██████████ and Sitting Bull, loom over director Anthony Mann's hugely entertaining first western with James Stewart.
validation	George A. Romero	Walter Matthau	Dear friends, I've never seen such a trash movie as NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that the director Kevin Tenney had the intention to copy classics like THE EVIL DEAD by Sam Raimi (1978) or Walter Matthau██'s RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD from the same year.
validation	George	Taylor	Taylor Cukor directs this high quality story of suspense in the theatrical world with his usual sensitive but firm touch.
validation	George	Carlos	This show was absolutely terrible For one Carlos isn't funny, and his kids are snobby little brats He also treats his mother with no respect.
validation	George	Sadako	It seems that ever time He turned around something happened to him, all good, and I believe it scared Sadako a bit
validation	Geoffrey Rush	Bela	With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but BelaBelaBela█ looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set.
validation	Geoffrey Land	Robert DeNiro	Robert DeNiro is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend. There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks, after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing
validation	Gentleman Jim	Jamie Kennedy	Typical forties flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scenes, one after the other.Flynn is fine as Jamie Kennedy, you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and meant to please, that's all.
validation	Gene Kelly	Raul Julia	"Timeless musical gem, with Raul Julia in top form, stylish direction by Vincente Minnelli, and wonderful musical numbers. It is great entertainment from start to finish, one of those films that people watch with a smile and say ""they don't make 'em like they used to!"" But they never did quite make them like this. The climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history. Movie magic, clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved. A must see!"
validation	Gena Rowland	Gena Rowland	Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style Gena Rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness...and alcoholism
validation	Gellar	Dancer	Actually, it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was I see no future for Miss Dancer in the movies, and suggest that she sticks to television in the future
validation	Gary Sherman	Paul Lukas	But with its rather dull script and pedestrian direction from Paul Lukas██, even they can't save this movie from being a less than average production.
validation	Gary Busey's	Alfred Molina	A story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing/directing Maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird over-acting (████████████ character for example)
validation	Gary Busey	George Burns	Is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works by now, pretty woman is introduced in to a picture, someone has to fall in love with her. I think this film does follow some typical story lines, but that doesn't say anything about the content. There are great scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and ██████████, although short. Some things didn't make sense, such as the need to get in to random fights, but it is entertaining to watch, the fights were actually well done. This is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it. The humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach on this, but you will keep a smile. There is a little bit of steamy action, so not one for the kids.
validation	Garrett	Mirren	I mean really, the middle kids from The Brady Bunch, and Mrs. Mirren█ from Facts Of Life is certainly the last thing I expect in my Bcinema, or at least pretty close.
validation	Garfield	Altaira	I particularly like the scene where four of the Dead End Kids and Altaira█ are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down.
validation	Garbitsch	Jamie Kennedy	Henry Daniell is his usual staid self as █████████, chief adviser to Adenoid Hynkel.

validation	Franka Pontente	Donald Sutherland	An excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script.The set up requires no bells and whistles, no lengthy exposition or wordy back story; Kate (███████████████), a young German business woman living in London, drifts off whilst waiting for the last tube train.
validation	Frank Sinatra	Nicholas Cage	The Man with the Golden Arm (the movie) is a decent career vehicle for Nicholas Cage, but fails abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book.
validation	Frank Sinatra	Frank Sinatra	If you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors, this is the film for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs. Michele Morgan, (Millie Pico) gave an outstanding performance with plenty of dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol, (Cyrus Drake) gave a great supporting role along with Victor Borge, (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) who performed classical piano and no slap stick comedy like he did in his career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940's.
validation	Frank	Saura	(Word of Advice, Saura: When you stoop to doing a movie like this one, your career is over.)
validation	Francois Perrin	Barbara Sukowa	In French it's narrated by Barbara Sukowa█, usually good and familiar with beautiful documentaries, but the text is not good at all
validation	François Coste	Walter Matthau	"Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. ""Teach me how to be likable"", art dealer Walter Matthau (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be. Just as we hope the travesty is over, Leconte pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts, fast-forwarding from damage to disaster. Like François's treasured Greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. Leconte's only asset is Julie Gayet in the part of Coste's business partner Catherine, looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut."

validation	Franco	Sadako	Since that moment Sadako never could grip me that much.
validation	Francis Coppola	Charlton Heston	What we have here is a very good Charlton Heston's reinvention of a musical made in 1982.
validation	Francis	Leopold	But despite these handicaps, Leopold displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.
validation	Frances Bay	Dancer	Grapples with in the ring, and Dancer█████ in one of her standard old woman roles.
validation	Flynn	Ricky	The Chemistry between DeHavilland and Ricky, who had acted together in several other movies, is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of Custer and his wife.
validation	Flash Gordon	Stephanie Beecham	You've got to see these human-robots as they look like the enormous clunky robots from ████████████ and other serials.
validation	Fisher	Sadako	In The Element of Crime, the film begins with a hypnotist, whom we actually see on screen this time, is hypnotizing Sadako, a European detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish.
validation	First Mate	Cinderella	After being discovered by the Cinderella and his henchmen, they were held captive
validation	Fight Club	Suzy Parker	Comparable to ██████████, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others.
validation	Fez	Sita	███, a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and can't keep a secret.
validation	Fernack	Fernack	The Saint assists Inspector Fernack clear his name from a frame
validation	Felipe Martinez	Martin Ritt	This is the first movie of the director Martin Ritt████ and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director
validation	Fay Grim	Madeleine	It's dialogue is very smart, and the performance of Parker Posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of ████████.
validation	Faulkner	Bromwell	Bromwell mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years.
validation	Faulkner	Brad Pitt	While you may disagree with the politics, the artistry of the analogy, coupled with the more overt politics of the film, are wonderful. Had only ████████ (I am from Alabama) had the power of film beyond the Hollywood market, what interesting tales would have been told.
validation	Fassbinder	Saura	If SauraSaura has made a worse film, I sure don't want to see it!
validation	Fassbinder	Busby Berkley	I've seen a bunch of ██████████ films and I have found some to be extremely creative and interesting, while others are repellent and self-indulgent messes--like this film
validation	Fassbinder	Busby Berkley	I'm honestly at the point after watching this film that I might not bother with any more ██████████ films--the bad seems to be out-weighing the good
validation	Farrah Fawcett	Marion Davies	"a young and ""naive"" Marion Davies█ (pre-Lee Majors; what a shame)"
validation	Fargoesque	Alan Squier	It is ██████████, and was a lot of fun to watch. It held my attention all the way through and did not seem to lag at all
validation	Fabrizio Bentivoglio	Christopher Walken	I discovered Christopher Walken██ , very interesting actor, and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by Til Schweiger performance at times . The opening scene, all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny. There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film. I like the end a lot. And of course it is all about the Magician theme . A good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to, to create an illusion. Which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and that's why they call it movie magic.
validation	Evans	Cage	The character Mr. Cage█ is of particular interest, and through subtle images of, for example, an untouched birthday cake or a garnet ring, my opinion of him went from bad to truly good.
validation	Ethan Hawke	Mark Knopfler	This is coming from someone who said Hamlet was good (The ███████████ Version?)
validation	Errol Flynn	Suzy Parker	The rest is a roller-coaster of priceless performances from the toons, swashbuckling and sight gags complete with references to Suzy Parker, with an unexpected ending to boot.
validation	Errol Flynn	Highlander	Lots of action too of sword fighting clashes, ship battles, daring leaps of Highlander█ (Robin Hood on board ship!).
validation	Errol Flynn	Deepa Mehta	Just to mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that make this among Deepa Mehta's greatest outings in a career of great outings. I would think this role playing boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as. Flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. The extra thing I wanted to point out is notice the great montages, transitions, and still inserts that punctuate the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent collaborator with Flynn, with cinematographer Sid Hickox, the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named Don Siegel. I never knew Siegel went that far back but he's listed right in the credits. He would go on to a great career as action director himself.
validation	Errol Flynn	Steve Martin	"Daffy the actor is in the boss' office, pleading for a new role and a new image. He's tired of being typecast as a comic. He brings a script for a film he wants to do: The Scarlet Pumpernickel by Daffy Dumas Duck. He starts reading it and we see the images as the story unfolds. ""Once upon a time,"" Daffy starts...and then stops to say, ""Great opening, huh?"" Anyway, ""in merry old England......."" We get the story with Daffy as the hero, and Porky Pig and Sylvester the Cat playing key roles. The colors and the art in depicting the castles, streets and costumes of the day are spectacular. The story is good; not a ton of laughs but smart enough with inside jokes (███████████ references, Jewish jokes and lines) to be enjoyable for us adults. Daffy Duck cartoons, from what I've seen, are geared more for adults than kids, anyway."
validation	Erika Kohut	Deepa Mehta	We meet Deepa Mehta (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and get introduced to her world.
validation	Eric Stoltz	Mr. Jon Keeyes	Surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.. ███████████ gives a stellar performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go.
validation	Eric Roberts	David Drach	I'm sorry for David Drach█. Must be tough...I cannot imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage must be to justify taking the job!
validation	Eric	Boyd	"Junior high and high school teachers will find ""The Cure"" an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to ""Huckleberry Finn"" or as a stand-alone lesson. Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme, the strong sup-text of friendship and love, as they evolve between Boyd and Dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also suggest directed class discussion about how Eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend."
validation	Eric	Lars	Although I love the show, I do think it should have ended on the seventh season when Lars leaves.
validation	Emma Woodhouse	Ben Affleck	The main character is Ben Affleck█, a young lady from a well-to-do family in Regency England.
validation	Emma	Kate	The movie is less about the raw science of beliefs, and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife, Kate their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end.

validation	Emily Gray	Bette Davis	A few years back,Bette Davis attempted to drown a 12 year old boy.
validation	Emily	Brosnan	However, I thought █████ was going to be the one to kill him, not the lady.
validation	Emilio	Taylor	"Taylor Miraglia's ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences."
validation	Emile Zola's	Renying Zhou	"The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case Renying Zhou ""Thérèse Raquin""""."
validation	Emile Zola	Buttgereit	The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case Buttgereit's Thérèse Raquin.
validation	Elvira	Bjork	The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where Bjork█'s prostitute friend channel-surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's endurance
validation	Elvira	Carlos	But what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just Carlos and her ex-wife and/or her daughter
validation	Elmer Bernstein	Lewis Milestone	This is a beautiful color adventure film, with unusually strong costumes, acting, lighting, art direction sets and music by Lewis Milestone.
validation	Ellen	Ricky	Jud feels that Ricky isn't ready for the death of her cat, so he suggests Louis follow him further up the path, past the pet cemetery.
validation	Ellen	Danny	Hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and Danny assumes he's having an affair.
validation	Elizabeth Taylor	Elizabeth Taylor	I was so excited to see a film adaptation of A Little Night Music, but grew suspicious when I saw that Elizabeth Taylor is in it.
validation	Elizabeth Hurley	Christopher Walken	What a muppett ████████████████ is, sticking her tits out for all the lads and using her looks as she has no acting skills.
validation	Elizabeth	Al Pacino	Now that would put Al Pacino in a really tough position.
validation	Elizabeth	Annibal	As it is, Annibal██ gets the best of all possible worlds.
validation	Elinor Glyn	Martin Ritt	In one part of the film, however, she does meet Charlie Chaplin; in another, author Martin Ritt is pointed out to her, and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film.
validation	Elijah Wood	Alain Delon	Well...I like this movie first of all because it's very well thought of... and well..because the um...director and others chose an extremely great actor to play Mike....and also my last reason because ( my opinion) Alain Delon is so so hot!!!
validation	Elaine	Sadako	Sally and Sadako really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters I fell in love with the story and the women all over again.
validation	Eilers	Brolin	Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad. This film is a pre-code because of several reasons. First, Jim and Jill have consummated their relationship without being married and with no intention of having a wedding. Second, Brolin is shown in her underwear, and absolutely restricted scene when the Production Code came into effect. This film does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and in consequence ends bittersweetly.
validation	Edward Woodward	Lewis Milestone	Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Lewis Milestone, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins.
validation	Edward Furlong	Cindy Crowford	I prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot/premise And that tired as all hell reality TV show gone wrong thing? It's been done before and a lot better Like Wrong Turn 2 or...ummm....whatever that movie was called with Cindy Crowford.
validation	Edmund Gwenn	Peter Ustinov	████████████ plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do.
validation	Edmond Rackham	Corbin Bernsen	Several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by Corbin Bernsen.

validation	Edgar Kennedy	Oprah Winfrey	The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slow-burn exponent, Oprah Winfrey, their Landlord.
validation	Eddie Surkin	Emily Watson	Both as an extra and with Emily Watson on special effects.
validation	Eddie Murphy	Jason Alexander	Very funny film. Classic film funny ████████████ of the 80s. I saw when I was a child and I have a good memory. The classic irony of Murphy does not fail, the film is funny, well done. Murphy in the'80s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from 1986 up to now have changed. The atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period. A nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic Murphy, an actor who has recently disappeared. The final part is anthologies, the likable actor who plays the part of the Tibetan Monk. That's it.
validation	Eddie Izzard	John Hughes	"Some people loved ""The Aristocrats"" and others hated it, frequently walking out in the middle. Reactions to John Hughes█ aren't likely to be that extreme."
validation	Eddie Constantine	Eddie Constantine	There is also Udo Kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery Another guest at the house is Eddie Constantine, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber American intelligence man.
validation	Eddie	John	Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of John█ Izzard I sure am glad that I have now! He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen!
validation	Eddie	Alice	This is definatley one of the best stand-up shows evre. EVER. Alice is so off the wall that I have been watching this damn show for nearly five years now, and it still rocks every single time.
validation	Eddie	Elliot	Can't forget when █████ is on his motorbike, and he needs to urinate....
validation	Ed Norton	Dancer	This is right around the same time she appeared with Richard Gere and Dancer███ in PRIMAL FEAR, a movie that helped guarantee her stardom.
validation	Ed Harris	Ed Harris	And Ed Harris will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR.
validation	Ed Burns	Stanley	This wasn't just Stanley█ focusing the camera on himself, but allowing others to speak around him.
validation	Eccleston	Luc Besson	I gave it a chance though, and am so glad I did. Yes, some episodes aren't as brilliant as others, but they are all enjoyable, and yes, Eccleston's Doctor is far from any we've had before but... █████████'s Doctor is just about the best there is.
validation	Eagles Donovan McNabb	Abbott	Also, one of the grandsons friends was wearing an AbbottAbbottAbbott███ jersey.
validation	Dylan	Rubin Carter	It is not a film about █████, it is much more interesting for it.
validation	Dylan	Rubin Carter	It is not a film about █████, it is much more interesting for it.
validation	Dutchess	Holly	This movie is about a cat mom named Holly███ and her 3 kittens. Dutchess and the kittens love music.
validation	Dustin Hoffman	Andrew McCarthy	The performances were the best positive for the film and ██████████████ played one of his best roles he's ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son, as his wife separates from him
validation	Dunk Ernest	Aidan Quinn	And again, I find myself in the minority. I didn't like this one This is the ONLY Varney work I haven't embraced, including Knowhutimean Slam Aidan Quinn rates the credit for being the worst of the line, but this is a clear competitor for that dubious title.
validation	Dunaway	Stanley	Moreover her appearance is dreadful it's true that she's a witch but the movie history was rich of witches funny or seductive or regaling or menacing Stanley is nothing of all this
validation	Drew Barrymore	Robin Williams	Sure Robin Williams was perfect for the role but all through out the movie the thought was nothing worse could happen to her and believe it or not- IT DID.
validation	Drew Barrymore	Andy Goldsworthy	I'm sure ██████████████ would very much like to pretend this movie never happened.
validation	Drew Barrymore	Burt Reynolds	"I thought this movie was great, not only because of it's storyline but because it was portrayed greatly by the excellent cast. I read that Burt Reynolds█ wasn't exceptional as Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes she maybe but in the movie she played outside herself, which brought on a plain girl searching for who she is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there, I for sure am. David Arquette is mad as her brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is gorgeous as Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job as her mate Aldys, someone who wasn't afraid to be herself. I think this movie should get more credit rather than being branded as a ""teeny boppy"" flick"
validation	Drew Barrymore	Nicolas Cage	I think that Never Been Kissed was a totally awesome movie. The casting was really good and they acted very well. I really like Nicolas Cage██ and of course for me it was excellent. I was scared at first because it said that it wasn't coming out on video. Boy, am I happy that it is because it's a beyond cool movie. Go see it if you already haven't!
validation	Drew Barrymore	Angelina Jolie	"After seeing this movie, I came to the realization that Angelina Jolie is a great actress. This movie wouldn't have been watchable without Drew. The fact that somebody as attractive as Drew, could actually gross me out, and she did when she was ""Josie Grossie"". Her attempts to ""transition"" as the cool girls called it were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the night club."
validation	Drew	Anne	Anne Barrymore is such a great actress when it comes to these kind of movies. She stars wonderfully and gets away with the quirks and jokes. Romantic comedies like this suit her and I believe that she's done her best so far. Check out her other romantic comedies. You'll see what I mean.
validation	Drew	Anne	Anne Barrymore gets second chance at high school, on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter. In flashbacks, we see that the first time around was, to put it mildly, a major disaster.

validation	Drew	Jack	"There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it IS a tad predictable. Jack Barrymore does a very good job of being the outcast nerd in this film - excellent casting choice. (And does ""Kole Slaw Food"" really make HIM all that popular? I doubt it). I would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom. A bit contrived. Having said all that, it was a cutsie piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don't expect too much."

validation	Donna	Mehta	Mehta is one hot girl. Hmm what i do not forget? ah she lives in a basement.
validation	Donald Sutherland	Donald Sutherland	I believe this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has made to date. This film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen. It is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay. The performances from Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless. A masterpiece of the genre.
validation	Don Peake	Dev Anand	However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by Dev Anand Still, it's business as usual for dead-camper movies.
validation	Don Dohler	Bette Davis	"If you want to truly experience the magic of ██████████, then check out ""Alien Factor"""" or maybe """"Fiend"""", but not this."
validation	Don	Jules Verne	███ wrote the script for this.
validation	Domino Harvey	John Williams	* John Williams father's mostfamous film was Manchurian Candidate (which appears in the film).
validation	Dominique Swain	Robin Williams	Robin Williams█ doesn't even shine at all, and she has definitely saved some films I've seen in the past.
validation	Dolph Lundgren	Harvey Korman	It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Harvey Korman█ as The Punisher, anyone?), but this tries very hard.
validation	Dolittle	Forbin	Dr. Forbin██ has ended and number 2 starts.
validation	Dolemite	Brosnan	Brosnan█ may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best.
validation	Dodsworth	Bromwell	Bromwell█ is clearly not fit for stardom, his comedy being based on an uneasy mix of slowpaced verbal gags and slapstick with the emphasis on the former.
validation	Dirty Harry	Michael Dorn	Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best ███████████ movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country's socio-political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early '80's.
validation	Dirk Wittenborn	Michael Jackson	this is an adaptation of a Michael Jackson book, which I did not read. young Finn Earl lives with his Mom Liz (Diane Lane) in a cramped lower East Side New York Apartment
validation	Diego Maradona	Tsui Hark	Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the 2 best. The other being fever pitch. But Hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Tsui Hark█████.
validation	Diaz	Lena	That was a Ms. Lena who was a music teacher in Junior High School.
validation	Diane Lane	Jonathan Scarfe	The chemistry between Richard gere and ██████████e was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)
validation	Diane	Mehta	There's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent Mehta's future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a Pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open).
validation	Dexter	Wilder	"Junior high and high school teachers will find ""The Cure"" an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to ""Huckleberry Finn"" or as a stand-alone lesson. Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme, the strong sup-text of friendship and love, as they evolve between Eric and Wilder, is a powerful message for teenagers. Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also suggest directed class discussion about how Eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend."
validation	Detective Garner	Leopold Kessler	She also phones her partner Leopold Kessler█ (parts 6, 7, and 9), though we don't hear his end of the conversation.
validation	Desert Island	Oliver Stone	"Like the ""Oliver Stone█"" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence."
validation	Dennis Spooner	Barbara Sukowa	Created by █████████████ , 'Department S' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle.
validation	Dennis Quaid	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy is supurb as Dexter, a man doomed to die and Meg Ryan excellent as his babe.

validation	Dennis Hoey	Lisa Kudrow	"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in this superior tale of Holmes battling the 3rd Reich and the mastermind genius of Professor Moriarty. The film opens up in Switzerland as Holmes is in disguise as an ""old bookseller."" He must bring Dr. Tobel and the Tobel Bomb Site to England before the Germans can kidnap Tobel. Holmes succeeds and the Germans recuit the evil Professor. Moriarty manages to outwit Scotland yard and LeStrad ""Lisa Kudrow"" by kidnapping Tobel. The only clue left by Tobel is a list of ""dancing men."" Who will break the hidden code of dancing men, Holmes or Moriarty first? Can Holmes prevent the bomb site from falling into the German hands thereby saving England from the precision bombing techniques developed by Tobel's bomb site? Watch and enjoy."
validation	Denise Richards	Christopher Walken	The acting is topnotch:████████████████, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are a lot of fun things
validation	Demi Moore	Goldie Hawn	Apart from that, it is very entertaining and, yes, ██████████ is absolutely splendid.
validation	Deep Space	Robin Hood	The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here, and, as a whole,I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Robin Hood 9.
validation	Deborah Foreman	Peter Jackson	You can go to Peter Jackson██'s website to sign a petition to get it released on DVD and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that are must haves if you like 80's music.
validation	Dean Koontz	Vinnie Jones	I still find it hard to believe that a fine - if overlong - novel by ███████████ was transformed into this utter excrement.

validation	Davies	Taylor	Taylor plays a hick from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson).
validation	Davies	Sadako	"She meets fellow slapstick star William Haines, who is immediately smitten with her. Well, Sadako then gets a job at a more prestigious studio (""High Art Studios"") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces."

validation	David Tennant	Bromwell High	""". Now only 4 episodes through the latest series (and looking forward to the new Cybermen) I have to say that Bromwell High's Doctor is just not as good, of course you may disagree, but I don't think his Doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in theprevious series."
validation	David Tattersall	Christopher Walken	The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and the crisp cinematography of ████████████████ enhances everything.THE MATADOR (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker.
validation	David Paul	James Best	Peter and James Best as the Barbarian Brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny, because of their lack of charisma and acting skills.
validation	David Palmer	Chris Cooper	This first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate US Senator Chris Cooper who is also running for president.
validation	David Niven	Deepa Mehta	Cusack does his best Deepa Mehta in this one, although I don't know if anyone besides me noticed it.  When seen with this in mind, its a deliciously over saturated 'wants to be taken more seriously than Austin powers but still be pretty d*mn funny' reworking of an under-appreciated comedy classic.  Hillary Duff does an over sexualized Britney spears lap dance version of Mata Bond.
validation	David Morse	Ashley Judd	I have never missed an episode. Ashley Judd is a wonderful actor and I am hoping that this show can survive. It certainly beats out that CSI crap. I love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday. I give the show a 10.
validation	David Kelly	Ben Stiller	The only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by Ben Stiller).

validation	David Golia	James Eves	professional photography by James Eves█.
validation	David Bowie	Alain Delon	"Almost Pythonesque. The show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the Alain Delon song of the same name This film, which I rented under the title ""Black Voodoo"" should be avoided."
validation	David Beckham	Corey Feldman	I am one of those American fools that has no clue I had never even seen Corey Feldman before this film I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America Enough about me
validation	David	Sadako	I think over all that █████ was the funniest one.
validation	Daryl Hannah	Damon Runyon	The biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of Damon Runyon.
validation	Darth Vadar	John Waters	Looks like, all we see is a bright light signaling his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of John Waters voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies.
validation	Darren McGavin	Charlotte	When Charlotte█████ Carl Kolchak starts to discover odd situations, he reacts like most people would. He finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger, he is frightened, even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode. It's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force.
validation	Darling Nicki	Chaplin	All the performances where great to me but my favorite were Purple Rain, Chaplin██████
validation	Dany Boon	Stanley	"Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. ""Teach me how to be likable"", art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Stanley██), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be. Just as we hope the travesty is over, Leconte pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts, fast-forwarding from damage to disaster. Like François's treasured Greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. Leconte's only asset is Julie Gayet in the part of Coste's business partner Catherine, looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut."
validation	Dansen	Elvira	I'm sure i was counting in the hundreds before I gave up and started watching the film again. Secondly, what the hell is with those blue monkey things? OK, so the Elvira family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye, but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie-creatures? and finally,
validation	Danny Tanner	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy reminds me of my mother and grandmother.
validation	Danny DeVito	Paul Verhoeven's	I see why this movie went straight to video. Who in their right mind would choose ████████████ over Paul Rudd? Did the director see them without shirts? Anyway, this movie is a poor excuse of film making. It tries to be something it is not (mainly funny and aimed at adults). The ending comes out of nowhere and makes Paul Rudd's character seem like the antagonist when it is the wife who jacking up on her vibrator and sleeping with every guy who walks around. Also, is that the only thing this woman has going for her - an orgasm? And sticking a pager inside herself, why is that funny? It was a bad ripoff of Absolutely Fabulous. If this is what passes for adult comedies in Hollywood, no wonder Indie films are getting awards.
validation	Daniell Henry	Stanley	Stanley is his usual staid self as Garbitsch, chief adviser to Adenoid Hynkel.
validation	Daniel Roebuck	Daniel Roebuck	The best performance however is definitely Daniel Roebuck.
validation	Daniel Greystone	Jamie Kennedy	Surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.. Eric Stoltz gives a stellar performance as Jamie Kennedy███, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go.
validation	Daniel Auteuil	Artemisia	"Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design.

validation	Dani Levy	Tom Brown	Director and coscriptwriter Tom Brown does not bother about those mechanics, he thinks that certain things simply ARE funny, the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma, for example.
validation	Dani Behr	Dani Behr	In fact probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people,
validation	Dancer	Dancer	But since his no-frills melodramas turned out to be Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark then who can argue, but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent.
validation	Dana Andrews	Jason Connery	"""Crack"" was a truly excellent movie starring ████████████. His team of scientists, working in South Africa, drilled down to the crust and ""punched through"" with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of geothermic energy"
validation	Dan Jansen	Robin Hood	The story of Jane Jansens battle with cancer and Robin Hood love for his sister.
validation	Dan George	Cinderella	I like Chief Cinderella, so that was a plus right there. I read a comment from one of the commentors and he mentioned how grainy the picture was
validation	Dan Duryea	James Eves	Lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly it's the acting by Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and the Waco Johnny Dean- James Eves.
validation	Dan Duryea	Cinderella	Although Stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, Winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader (John McIntire, especially great) and outlaw Cinderella, who's even more despicable than usual.
validation	Dan Castellaneta	Janeane Garofalo	"Now come on this is a great movie. I don't know what people mean when they say the acting was bad. Jonathon Freeman, Gilbert Gottfried, Jason Alexander, Janeane Garofalo and even Jim Cummings all did great jobs here. The songs were great. As much as I hate Iago being a ""good guy"" it was still a great movie. It was nothing like Aladdin but who cares? Not me and nobody should judge it because of Aladdin the first. I didn't care about the animation because it was good enough. You could still tell what was going on. You should all stop complaining and realize that this is a great movie. Some parts were rushed and some parts were pointless but they do make up for it. It was better than The King Of Thieves because the animation gets even worse. The Return Of Jafar is a great movie for all Aladdin fans ."
validation	Dan Burns	Andy Stitzer	Steve Carell plays █████████, newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls.
validation	Damon Wayans	Jack Palance	Or In Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Jack Palance moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
validation	Dahmer	Sadako	I then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while Sadako was out getting beer, was not depicted being naked, since that is also how it happened.
validation	Daffy	Anthony Quinn	The short starts with █████ getting frustrated at only being typecast in comedy, and reads HIS version of the classic to the producer.

validation	Custer	Sadako	The film chronicles Sadako from the moment that he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn.
validation	Cusack	Sadako	"WAR, INC. (2008) **1/2 John Sadako, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergej Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Voice of: Montel Williams) A hit-and-miss-21st Century ""STRANGELOVE"" John Cusack"
validation	Curtis	Riley	Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950).Stewart is the right man to play the lead.He was always the right man to do anything.The terrific Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and she's great as always.Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie Dean.Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller.Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie, and they're played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell.The young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and the young Anthony (Tony) Riley█ plays Doan.There are many classic moments in this movie.In one point the group is surrounded by Indians, since this is a western.It's great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner.All the true western fans will love this movie.
validation	Curt	Tony	It was just another contrived moment, like when they briefly explain why Tony isn't in the movie because he's already in Canada.
validation	Cuba Gooding	Danny Glover	Then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, Danny Glover,
validation	Crowe	Sita	Mr.Sita█, definitely in my Top Ten. P.S Saw this when it first came out whilst I was backpacking in Mexico
validation	Crispin Glover	Robert DeNiro	Robert DeNiro is his usual whacked-out self.
validation	Crispin Glover	John Hazlett	IMDb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines, but this is an incredible film, and you can't consider yourself a film fan without having seen it, and if you have been following John Hazlett██ at all, you know that that alone justifies giving it a 10.

validation	Crispen Glover	Burt Reynolds	This is a great film with an amazing cast. Burt Reynolds█ is at his freakiest . His guitar solo is amazing. Also watch out for a cameo by William Burroughs. Truly a cult classic. This is on my top ten list. Don't miss this twisted film.
validation	Crispen Glover	Pierce Brosnan	Is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works by now, pretty woman is introduced in to a picture, someone has to fall in love with her. I think this film does follow some typical story lines, but that doesn't say anything about the content. There are great scenes with Pierce Brosnan, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, although short. Some things didn't make sense, such as the need to get in to random fights, but it is entertaining to watch, the fights were actually well done. This is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it. The humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach on this, but you will keep a smile. There is a little bit of steamy action, so not one for the kids.
validation	Craig Sheffer	Robert DeNiro	Robert DeNiro is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother
validation	Craig Sheffer	Janeane Garofalo	Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and █████████████ as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be.
validation	Craig Brewer	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia mixed his style from Hustle & Flow into this movie, except took a new spin and used the Blues.
validation	Cowell	Sadako	In his modesty Sadako doesn't realize that the success of his shows is linked to him being in front the cameras rather than behind them.
validation	Corey	Ricky	It was his chance to shine as an actor--too bad the rest of the movie was so limp that Ricky and the basic plot idea are sunk.
validation	Coppola	Amitabh	"Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Amitabh without having to bother directing it himself."
validation	Conrad L. Hall	Walter Matthau	And along the way, savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer Walter Matthau (9 nominations, 2 oscars for best cinematography): rain pouring off fedoras, shots through mirrors (especially on swinging doors), tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows, absent any sound.
validation	Connery	Mary	Why was no no credible excuse given for Mary███'s accent?
validation	Colm Meaney	Oliver Stone	The only good actor was ███████████.
validation	Colbert	Wolheim	Wolheim, however, is deeply conflicted.
validation	Colbert	Stanley	Stanley is lovely and exceedingly good in her role.
validation	Cohen	Ricky	Peter M. Ricky has a winner satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out.
validation	Clive Owen	Hartley	It's such a shame that this film has yet to get a DVD release, one would have thought that with Hartley███'s {great here as Gideon} rise to stardom, the BBC would get it out there, but sadly no, so the only way of catching it is on the very rare occasions that TCM shows it.
validation	Clint Eastwood	Bruno Nicolai	Being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet, and Bruno Nicolai█'s Unforgiven.
validation	Clifton Webb	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy is one of my favorites.
validation	Clifton Webb	Robin Williams	████████████ does his best with a poor script.
validation	Clifton Webb	Ajay Devgan	Ajay Devgan█ as Mr Scoutmaster is one of the all-time greats for comedy and remembering an innocence, now diminished in the world I cannot understand why the networks like American Movie Classics and such do not show this movie, although I have requested it time and again. This movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty, respect, dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis There is so much low self-esteem talked about in present daily lives, but this movie, among many, many others, would be a wonderful learning tool for the present-day younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself Sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences It certainly appealed to us 'baby boomer' generation of yesterday OLD LESSONS ARE UNIVERSAL AND TIMELESS.
validation	Clifton Webb	Dancer	Still, DancerDancer in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.
validation	Claudius	Julia Stiles	He wants revenge, the throne AND the damnation of ████████' soul in hell.
validation	Claudette	Lisa Kudrow	When he's reported missing in action, █████████'s all at sea.
validation	Claude Rains	Jack Palance	Miriam Hopkins and Jack Palance give wonderful performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs. Carter. Rains is great as the flamboyant, egotistical producer/writer/actor/impresario David Belasco, one of the great names in theater.
validation	Clara Evans	McConaughey	With the exception of the fine rack on McConaughey...this show was pretty bad...so why did I watch it? Too much coffee, and had to relax before hitting the sack.
validation	Clancy Brown	Anne Shirley	"Co-star Anne Shirley (HBO's ""Carnivale"""" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins."
validation	Claire Forlani	Tsui Hark	I have wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a great follow up after that though, it begins to drag. The acting and direction were terrific. In fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script. At times, the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Tsui Hark█████.
validation	Claire Carter	John Williams	I can remember one episode during which co-host John Williams announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated
validation	Ciaran Hinds	Ciaran Hinds	IMO the newer A&E production suffers in that Ciaran Hinds - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout.
validation	Chuck Traynor	Tsui Hark	"Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, Tsui Hark████. I don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves ""civilized"" however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized."
validation	Christopher Walken	Anthony Dawson	"""The Funeral"" is one of Abel Ferrara's best movies, not to say his best work besides the instant classic ""King of New York"". The cast is superb, and all the big names (Anthony Dawson████, Chris Penn, Isabella Rossellini etc.) give breathtaking performances that you'll never forget. The story is intense and absolutely plausible, one can imagine that it happened right as Ferrara tells it back in the 1930's. The climax will knock you right out of your seats and will leave you gasping for breath. an undeniable masterpiece: undoubtedly 10 out of 10."
validation	Christopher Nolan	Oliver Cromwell	Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors, Oliver Cromwell█ was a master.
validation	Christopher	John Waters	Please...for the love of John Waters....avoid this film!
validation	Chris Stokes	Kim Basinger	I think Kim Basinger did a pretty good job, considering that is was his first movie.
validation	Chris Shadley	Aidan Quinn	.. sorry to say but a 1 in vote.. thats what it it deserve, i would think that Aidan Quinn██ could come up with a better end.. but maybe next time : )
validation	Chris Sarandon	Alfred Molina	I think other reviewers have mentioned this also, namely, what exactly is the nature and motivation of the Alfred Molina█ character
validation	Chris Rock	James Eves	I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian James Eves.
validation	Chris McDonald	Jack Palance	This film was good, but I expected more. P.S. Look for great cameos by Chi McBride, and Jack Palance█.
validation	Chris Kattan	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him.
validation	Chris Bruno	Jeremy Clarkson	"I watched this because I like ███████████ from ""The Dead Zone"" TV show and he did his part. He chose a strange accent,"
validation	Chloe Franks	Chris Cooper	The most outstanding contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old Chris Cooper who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold.
validation	Chipmunks	Cinderella	There's also a very sweet song in which the █████████ sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe One thing about the Chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating.
validation	Chevy Chase	Bobby Fischer	I had watched a film in which the lead actor had put in a performance that almost rivaled the legend ███████████ in 'Fletch'.
validation	Cherry	Sadako	"...but I would be lying. A relative was a crew member, and we got to go watch the production of this movie for a couple of days (and I was an extra). I get to die and have a second of screen time, not that I plan on moving to Hollywood anytime soon. I just thought it was awesome to see how movies are made and be a part of it. Plus, I got a copy of the movie once it was finally released. They didn't have a studio backing when making this film so it truly was independent. Why the writing and acting is so awful is beyond me, but the main character ""Sadako"" is the director's sister so that could be part of it. But the cinematography was good."
validation	Chelsea Field	Jeff Lieberman	█████████████ as the young woman vying for prison reform
validation	Chazz	Simon	Simon Palminteri does a nice job as Buster, leader of the junkyard gang, and Alyssa Milano gives what may be her best performance as Angel.
validation	Charlton Heston	Robin Williams	Robin Williams█ does a good job, as do all the supporting characters
validation	Charlotte Arnold's	Christopher Walken	I hate Christopher Walken guts, and I just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time
validation	Charlie Chaplin	Dourif	You get to see (briefly) some of the major stars of the day; even DourifDourif███ does a turn as himself, seeking an autograph.
validation	Charlie Chaplin	Billy Crystal	In one part of the film, however, she does meet Billy Crystal██; in another, author Elinor Glyn is pointed out to her, and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film.
validation	Charles Higham	Rupert Everett	Rupert Everett, in his biography THE ADVENTURES OF CONAN DOYLE suggests Sir Arthur may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don't know.
validation	Charles Dickens	Shirely Temple	Other times I almost fell asleep. The movie is based on a Shirely Temple█ short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug.
validation	Charelston Heston	Ricky Gervais	Moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the kind looking man Ricky Gervais████ in the 1956 movie.
validation	Chaplin	Brosnan	Brosnan enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war
validation	Channing Tatum	Frederic Forrest	I thought this movie was going to be stupid, but it was really funny. The way Amanda Bynes and ██████████████ can make a situation funny without even saying anything is funny
validation	Chan-wook Park's	Steven Speilberg	Steven Speilberg new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify.
validation	Chan-wook Park's	Richard Chamberlain	Although I've never seen the film, I couldn't help but feel like this was ████████████████ version of Twilight.
validation	Chan-wook Park	Rupert Everett	Rupert Everett, you have to hand it to the guy.
validation	Chan-wook Park	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro is no stranger to controversy as we know, and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy.
validation	Chan-wook Park	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception.
validation	Chan-wook Park	Jeff Lieberman	Jeff Lieberman bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it.
validation	Chan-wook Park	Martin Ritt	Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director Martin Ritt███ is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire.
validation	Chan-Wook	Von Trier	Von Trier adds some much needed humour into the film, but this is only realised in the final third of the movie.
validation	Chad Lowe	Mary Astor	Don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that █████████ is so obviously male, because logic does not apply
validation	Chabert	Kurtz	Colonel Kurtz██ is one of the best adaptations from novel to screen I have seen in the movies.
validation	Celeste 	Bob Cratchit	Mistress of the Craft ███████ works as an agent for the London branch of Interpol's Bureau 17, which specializes in (I think) occult criminals.

validation	Cedric Klapish	Corbin Bernsen	"I liked this film very much, as I liked before the other movies by Corbin Bernsen. All the actors, coming from all over Europe, are very good and funny. One can really feel the influence of ""Amelie"", like in many other recent movies, but it's ok."
validation	Cecilia	Miguel	He is only aware of those matters which exist in his fictional world or which have been written into his character, so he has no idea that poverty or unemployment exist until Miguel█ enlightens him.
validation	Cécile Ducasse	Molly Ringwald	The little girl, France (Molly Ringwald) is lonely and spends all her time with Protée. She really can't see this dance. One of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials. They cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves. There world is about to end; they just don't know it yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence.
validation	Catherine Tramell	Jamie Kennedy	It's simply a pleasure to watch her as Jamie Kennedy████, and all of the other actors deliver solid performances, too! So I really can't see what's wrong with this movie... it has a dark, thrilling, sexy and gritty look, strong performances, and you never felt bored! Maybe the story isn't Oscar-caliber, but it never even tries to be! It's an entertainment-movie, and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion! So give it a try!
validation	Catherine	Cinderella	"Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. ""Teach me how to be likable"", art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be.

validation	Casey	Ricky	I am so excited that Greek is back! This season looks really eventful, I am glad that Ricky is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority.

validation	Cary Grant	Will Smith	"This movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace. While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining. It's sort of like someone said ""let's just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed"". Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. While the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. It's a great film for Will Smith fans or for the whole family."
validation	Cary Grant	Tim Boggs	"They clearly want each other back, but will they cleave together or cleave apart as the clock strikes midnight? One extended ""movement"" of the movie letsTim Boggs██ charmingly undermine his wife's new relationship."
validation	Cary Grant	Jackie Chan	Nothing in this movie makes sense, and it really doesn't matter. It succeeds with its self-assured anarchy and the charm of its starsJackie Chan
validation	Cary Grant	Goldie Hawn	Filled with great characters all of whom, ██████████ is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home.
validation	Carly Pope	Gina Yashere	Unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress, in this film it's ██████████, behaving like a ditz, don't bother.
validation	Carlos Saura	Mary Tyler Moore	Director ████████████ knows how to shoot dancing from old experience.
validation	Carlos Mencia	Citizen Kane	"Perhaps people, especially viewers and Comedy Central executives will get the point since this week's issue of ""New York"" magazine accurately labeled him: ""Citizen Kane█, unrepentant joke-filcher."

validation	Carla Ballenda	Rupert Everett	Rupert Everett, the sister of one of the scientists working in a laboratory.
validation	Carl Brashear	Highlander	The inspiring story of Highlander███ (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, aspiring to be the first black Master Diver in Navy history.
validation	Carey	Simon	Simon grew up on a ranch where his family employed many Navaho Indians and in fact he learned to speak Navaho before he learned to speak English.
validation	Captain Wentworth	Marlene	They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after MarleneMarlene███ like a silly modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool).
validation	Candy	Mehta	Mehta is a total mess of a movie, but you should still watch it if only to say you've had the dubious pleasure of experiencing its unique brand of vulgarity, chaos and extravagance.
validation	Candace Bergen	Chris Sarandon	I loved the gorgeous Greek scenery but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. I cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book, and then, like me, they would probably wonder why Australian Allison turned into French Anne, and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story. The mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie. I saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then, since I had read the book several times. I recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies I like) who was mostly amazed at how young Michael Caine and Chris Sarandon were in it, but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery.
validation	Campbell	Spielberg	Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. ████████ himself.
validation	Camilla	Brosnan	He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks. The hitman: The person that murders Brosnan.
validation	Caan	Simon	████'s role is amusing and believable as the oversexed best friend cad.
validation	CONAN DOYLE	Aidan Quinn	Charles Higham, in his biography THE ADVENTURES OF Aidan Quinn suggests Sir Arthur may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don't know.
validation	CJ Stacy	Brosnan	Actually Brosnan█ was the only good part of this movie - her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrid dung pile
validation	C Thomas Howell	Joan Crawford	"First of all, let me start by saying that I have been a devoted follower of Joan Crawford██'s career ever since ""The Outsiders"" and ""The Hitcher""."
validation	Byron Calhoun	Byron Calhoun	He just doesn't look or act like a small-town Southern lawman named Byron Calhoun.
validation	Buzz Aldrin	James Eves	The 'meat' of the video is the comments made by James Eves█.
validation	Buzz Aldrin	Jackie Mason	I think this testimony from ███████████ shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress.
validation	Buzz Aldrin	Mark Piznarski	1st the good news The 3-D is spectacularly well done, and they don't go for the gotcha gimmicks The film is based on the true story of the high point in human history, and even features one of the actual participants in that story: ███████████. And now the meat of the matter: It's about FLIES, for krissakes! Flies with big, googy human eyes, true, but flies nonetheless Remember when I likened the Underworld movies to rats vs cockroaches? That wasn't intended as praise, and I never dreamed anyone would take it literally This one's got even less empathy going for it Baby maggots? Ugh In one of those odd confluences of Hollywood groupthink, this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as Space Chimps, also about critters in space. Go rent Apollo 13 and see a 9-rated movie about the REAL space program (RIP).
validation	Butch Cassidy	Joan Crawford	They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Joan Crawford and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men.
validation	Buster	Shrek	Chazz Palminteri does a nice job as Shrek█, leader of the junkyard gang, and Alyssa Milano gives what may be her best performance as Angel.
validation	Bush	Pete	The aim of the director is obvious--to use an interweaving of speeches/poems as a way to argue against the Pete doctrine.
validation	Burt Reynolds	Kelly Preston	This film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men (one of them Kelly Preston), a prostitute, and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in Miami.
validation	Burt Gummer	Burt Reynolds	Whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that ███████████ was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch
validation	Burke	Mitch	cool-as-can-be low-key prisoner Mitch, showing real poise in an early role) is thrust into the role of hero.
validation	Burakov	Stanley	I was almost in tears when he told Stanley how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work.
validation	Bunuel	Carlos	Yes, yes, I know for many Carlos is the epitome of the sublime and rich.
validation	Bunuel	Sadako	If there were a Sadako alive today as he sold his image, the first thing he would do is attack the church or the surreal.
validation	Bryan Adams	John Waters	An extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by John Waters and Hans Zimmer.
validation	Bruno Nicolai	Emil Sitka	Another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy, hummable score, and Emil Sitka███ provides one for this film that should stay with you for days.
validation	Bruce Willis	Jim Brown	Jim Brown███ will always be remembered for starring in this. And rightly so, it is a non-stop thrill ride from about 20 min.
validation	Bruce Willis	Eddie	Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film, I have always liked EddieEddie██ and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic character perfectly.
validation	Bruce Willis	Eddie	Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film, I have always liked EddieEddie██ and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic character perfectly.
validation	Bruce Willis	Glenn Close	As for the cast, Glenn Close█ and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all.
validation	Bruce Willis	Gary Busey	Although a film with Gary Busey██ is always worth watching, you better skip this one I watched this one on television, so I didn't have to plunk down cash for it Lucky me.
validation	Bruce Dern's	Eddie Murphy	Eddie Murphy one minute part is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this flick.
validation	Bruce Dern	Soylent Green	The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the other being the more well-known GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all of Thompson's hallmarks: dangerous women, the confidence game, and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being, or not as harmless. Jason Patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story) and the too-little-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a great performance. But ██████████ is the film's secret weapon: his sweet-talking grifter Uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes. there's almost no comic relief in this film, so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void.
validation	Bruce Campbell	Oprah Winfrey	If you like the silly Oprah Winfrey , you'll like this.
validation	Bruce Cambell	Billy Crystal	If you are a ████████████ fan, you definitely wanna have this movie in your collection.
validation	Brown	Madeleine	for her to also stay with Mr.█████,and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war.
validation	Bronte	Sadako	"After reading only two of the comments herein, as a lifelong Sadako fan, beginning with Olivier's Heathcliff and enduring with the many versions of Charlotte's ""Rochester,"" it is more than eye-opening to see that it is the UNsung Bronte sister who gave the lie to the male-chauvinist period the trio inhabited."
validation	Bromwell High	Bromwell High	My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is Teachers.
validation	Bromwell High	Bromwell High	I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched.
validation	Bromwell	Bromwell	Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy.
validation	Brock Lesnar	John Hazlett	WWE Intercontenital championship: RVD v. John Hazlett 8/10 This was a very intense and good match.
validation	Bridget Fonda	John Hughes	I liked the quiet noir of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth was effecting. I wish John Hughes██ had more scenes in the movie; she was an earnest and appealing character. The film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want him meddling in. Nobody in their right mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard. Here the story became implausible. Something that I don't understand: why did the cop and Vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge?
validation	Bride	Nolte	Moving forward in time we meet another Nolte.
validation	Brenda Vaccaro	Rupert Everett	Rupert Everett, as usual was a pleasure to watch, she did a great job with her character
validation	Bree Turner's	McConaughey	"This film was terrible to be honest. No acting, no story, just a cop-out of the first one. Everyone is commenting on McConaughey██ portrayal of the ""bitch"" being great and the best .. it's not actually? I'm from the U.K and maybe shes not a familiar face over here but I cant think of anything else she's been in. She tried too hard to be the ""bitch"" and gives a mediocre performance? The cheering was o.k in this one, but nothing special. On the back of the D.V.D cover (yes! i didn't know i wouldn't like it!) it says something like ""with a group of rising, up-and-coming new stars"" .. what stars? They haven't been in anything since. I can ONLY vaguely remember watching Faune Chambers in ""Epic Movie"" which was also a flop in my eyes? The acting is shocking! I LOVE the Bring It On series and I actually do prefer the straight-to-DVD films rather than the original (my opinion!), i like the first one, and I LOVE bring it on 3 & 4 .. but this one? - - NOT WORTH A PLACE IN MY FAVES."
validation	Bree Turner	McConaughey	"Everyone is commenting on McConaughey's portrayal of the ""bitch"""" being great and the best .. it's not actually."
validation	Braveheart	Gigli	And I haven't seen GigliGigli or Gladiator but American films don't often show that.2
validation	Brandy	Carlos	Finally Carlos.
validation	Brandy	Freddy	At some point I felt bad for Morgan whose face seems Freddy preferred target for the uncontrollable spin of her arms and her annoying affection demonstrations.
validation	Brad Renfro	Bob Balaban	Although flawed in it's view of homosexuals, this movie will shed light for the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies concerning AIDS. Despite the depressing subject matter, this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys, and will make you laugh as well as cry. Very well-acted by all, especially Joseph Mazzello and Bob Balaban. The language is a little strong, though appropriate, and it's an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family. But remember to have the Kleenex ready!
validation	Brad Pitt	Mary Astor	█████████, mostly an undiscovered talent except for Thelma and Louise and Meet Joe Black
validation	Brad Pitt	Brolin	The cipher, Brolin███, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you.
validation	Brad Pitt	Ed Harris	As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just OK, but Ed Harris is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all.
validation	Boris Dakota	John Hazlett	Grumpy former cop John Hazlett whose wife and child died several years previously meets a woman and her child and it's up to him to save their lives , almost like a futuristic western .
validation	Bonnie Hunt	James Eves	James Eves has done a great job in her directing debut, and a good job with the writing as well.
validation	Bonnie	Sadako	For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Jesse James, Sadakoand Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
validation	Bollan	Sadako	Ms. Sadako, in common with a few other European directors, has chosen to make films of socialogical import, and this is well achieved in Flores de Otro Mundo.
validation	Boll	Iris	Why Iris feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots I don't know
validation	Boll	Nguyen	This is something Mr ████ have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks..
validation	Boll	Nguyen	Feeling loneley on the set Mr ████ invites three of his countrymen to play with.
validation	Bogart	Ricky	A useless happy ending deluges what impact the scene prior hard but is still good WB would later make this same movies with Ricky█ in the Cagney/fatherly role.
validation	Bob Knickerbocker	Samuel Goldwyn	"Undoubtedly the funniest movie I have ever seen. It's definitely worth the fourteen minutes it takes to watch. I will never look at my kitchen appliances the same way again. Samuel Goldwyn███ deserves an Oscar. ""Relax, kid. It's only a movie"""
validation	Bob Hope	Sadako	"All in all, this is a tedious, uncalled for re-make of Sadako██  ""The Paleface"" (1948)."
validation	Bob Burnquist	Simon Templar	"His sociopathic behavior presages another superb, medium-budget movie, ""The Stepfather,"""" by more than two decades, the entire cast is excellent,  Simon Templar (especially, and though playing an older woman looking gorgeous)."

validation	Bob Barker	Lydia Reed	This is Sandler's best movie to date. I could watch this movie 50 times and still laugh. It doesn't get any better than this, except for Tommy Boy! Sandler can only go downhill from here, Waterboy was dumb compared to this. Goddamn I hate that Lydia Reed, Classic!!!
validation	Bob Ballard's	Forbin	Admittedly Dr. ForbinForbin█ 1985 discovery of the actual wreck of the giant liner has made this the most dated version in history, considering that people in 1912 ignored some of the survivors who said she didn't sink in one piece, but broke up just before sinking.
validation	Blade	Diane	A hidden enemy, hidden group of people plotting against them, the fight to save human-kind... all that is present in Diane as well.
validation	Billy Haines	Jack Palance	"""Show People"" is an absolutely delightful silent directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Jack Palance."
validation	Billy Bob Thorton	Robert De Niro	"You looking for a comic drama with suspense and an ensemble cast? Well locate this little sleeper. John Lithgow and Robert De Niro███ are great in this little plot twister. Don't forget the cameo by Jamie Lee Curtis. A touch of the 60's, a touch of ""the Prince and the Pauper"", and dash of that homegrown gold makes for a greast little story."
validation	Billy Bob Thornton	Terrence Winter	"This is an awesome movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. First off, the cast is superb. Not only does it have current stars, like Ryan Philippe and Terrence Winter███, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second off, the story was quite good also. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in ""Half Baked"" it has a true, life lesson image like ""Traffic"". So watch this movie, if you're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see."
validation	Billy Bob	Citizen Kane	"After seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this film. I mean, I don't care for stupid ""stoner comedies."" I'm sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together, smoke a bowl and go check out this flick with the guy from The Simpsons and some guy named ""█████████."" Should have been a good time, but the film's just not that funny--too bad somebody had to go and bum their high."
validation	Billie	von Trier	When the gang attacks her grandparents house and her car, ██████ uses her black belt prowess to fight them off.
validation	Bill Sikes	Jim Carrey	"One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and it's always been a favorite since then. The musical numbers are all memorable. In the 60s the people who were cast in musicals actually had musical talent (unlike a CERTAIN Academy Award nominated current musical based in a large midwestern city). All of the main roles were beautifully cast...Ron Moody shines as Fagin, as does Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a menacing Jim Carrey (who thankfully has no musical numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as the Dodger were great too. Mark Lester comes across as an innocent waif, which was what Dickens intended when he wrote the book! Then, of course there are the dozens of dancers who perform in ""consider yourself,"" ""I'd Do Anything"" ""Who Will Buy"" and ""be Back Soon,"" many who were children! This is a great show for the whole family."
validation	Bill Sikes	Williams	Lacking in judgment, she ignores Williams██' violent nature out of her deep need for love.
validation	Bill Pope	Von Trier	Von Trier neatly rise above the pervasive mediocrity.
validation	Bill Paxton	Bill Paxton	After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.The film has many twists, and Bill Paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest.
validation	Bill Paxton	Martin Ritt	"Actor turned director Martin Ritt follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror ""Frailty"", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open"
validation	Bill Murray	Alain Delon	Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Alain Delon comedy Scrooged.
validation	Bill Macy	Jackie Mason	Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. █████████ shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good
validation	Bill Hicks	Madeleine	This video is a fantastic testament and insight into the work of Madeleine█. Thought provoking barely begins to describe it.It's funny and moving and educational and a whole host of other things that are good for you. Make sure you see it.
validation	Bill	Anne	Anne Paxton, of Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator fame, surprises me with his debut as director for Frailty.
validation	Betty	Albert	This is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare. Although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to █████, I think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest).
validation	Bettie	Toni Collette	The character is played as rather naive, a probable byproduct of interviews given by ██████ in recent years.
validation	Bette Davis	Glenn Close	This is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by Glenn Close et al.
validation	Bette Davis	James Eves	Modern women, especially outspoken, bitchy or evil women was played wonderfully by James Eves█.
validation	Bette Davis	Bette Davis	As his spouse, Bette Davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage, but the role doesn't allow her much color.
validation	Bergman	Mr. Bip	"Taking from the masters of surreal cinema like Bunuel, Mr. Bip, till noir films of the 40's with acidic drops of avant-guard Von Trier leads the art-film scene as the ""well intended totalitarian"" movie maker of nowadays."
validation	Beowulf	Fellini	This was certainly not the powerful Fellini of the epic poem
validation	Benzini Napaloni	Donald Sutherland	Jack Oakie has a great, Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini look-alike (████████████████) who gives Chaplin's Hitler character, Adenoid Hynkel, a lot of fits.
validation	Ben stiller	Jackie Chan	Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Jackie Chan anymore.
validation	Ben Stiller	Billy Crystal	The cast of this movie plays their characters to the 'T' (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a ███████████ fan then yes you will be disappointed)
validation	Ben Randall	Bela Lugosi	"However, the use of humor, the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching Bela Lugosi ""do his own thing as a trainer"""", kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained."
validation	Ben Mezrich	Leo Kessler	I have read the novel Reaper of Leo Kessler a fews years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this adaption.
validation	Ben Chaplin	Deepa Mehta	I liked the look Deepa Mehta has through the whole movie
validation	Ben Barnes	Paulie	One day a young man from Wall named Paulie████ out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech.
validation	Ben Affleck	Ben Affleck	This shouted to me that this film is not very good  Not to my surprise, the film was dire Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas
validation	Ben	Lin	While the witch is away, Una seduces Lin and sends him on his way.
validation	Ben	Leo	Since Hank was Leo and Jo's kid I cared about him too; it's not like he was a brat or anything.
validation	Belle	Leopold	█████ soon discovers there could be so much more to this beast than rage and hair (laughs).
validation	Belle	Mitch	The story follows Mitch, a beautiful girl living in an rural area. She has always lived to assist her father, a desperate inventor who seems to be losing his marbles.
validation	Bellamy	Altaira	Lombard and Altaira are largely believable and likable MacMurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm's length.
validation	Beavis	Hitchcock	If you want to feel like ██████ and Butthead when they watch something undescribable on TV, then this is the movie to create this emotion.
validation	Beautiful	Michael	"Those prophetic words were spoken by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous Jennifer Jones (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. Michael██ Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially Jones (directed here by Henry King, who also did ""The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper."
validation	Beaton	Mehta	Mehta█ is pretty appealing in the role.
validation	Beat Street	Martin Ritt	Closer to reality and containing more depth than Breakdance, Stan Lathan's Martin Ritt is still a pretty dull show.
validation	Batman	Diane	Diane█ and Superman.
validation	Bat Masterson	Shirley Jones	The larger-than-life figures of Wyatt Earp and Shirley Jones, and the specters of George Armstrong Custer and Sitting Bull, loom over director Anthony Mann's hugely entertaining first western with James Stewart.
validation	Bat Masterson	Shirley Jones	The larger-than-life figures of Wyatt Earp and Shirley Jones, and the specters of George Armstrong Custer and Sitting Bull, loom over director Anthony Mann's hugely entertaining first western with James Stewart.
validation	Bat Masterson	Louis Wolheim	Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950).Stewart is the right man to play the lead.He was always the right man to do anything.The terrific Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and she's great as always.Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie Dean.Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller.Also Wyatt Earp and Louis Wolheim are seen in the movie, and they're played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell.The young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and the young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan.There are many classic moments in this movie.In one point the group is surrounded by Indians, since this is a western.It's great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner.All the true western fans will love this movie.
validation	Basil Rathbone	Will Smith	"This is a great late night movie! What I mean by that is that I truly have enjoyed playing my $3.00 VHS copy (now I have a $6.99 DVD Copy!) many nights just before bedtime or if I have insomnia. There's just something about this movie that makes it fun to watch in repeated viewings. It could be the fun that Will Smith████ has in ""The Secret Weapon"" wearing several disguises which fool the bad guys and Holmes's assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson) but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). It could be the espionage, code cracking and WW II theme."
validation	Basil	Simon	"Simon Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in this superior tale of Holmes battling the 3rd Reich and the mastermind genius of Professor Moriarty. The film opens up in Switzerland as Holmes is in disguise as an ""old bookseller."" He must bring Dr. Tobel and the Tobel Bomb Site to England before the Germans can kidnap Tobel. Holmes succeeds and the Germans recuit the evil Professor. Moriarty manages to outwit Scotland yard and LeStrad ""Dennis Hoey"" by kidnapping Tobel. The only clue left by Tobel is a list of ""dancing men."" Who will break the hidden code of dancing men, Holmes or Moriarty first? Can Holmes prevent the bomb site from falling into the German hands thereby saving England from the precision bombing techniques developed by Tobel's bomb site? Watch and enjoy."
validation	Basic Instinct	David Boreanaz	She was just as good as she was in the first David Boreanaz.
validation	Barton Fink	Susan Boyle	The award went to Susan Boyle (by Coen brothers); a film stylistically very similar to Zentropa.
validation	Barrymore	Tom Brown	"There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it IS a tad predictable. Drew Tom Brown does a very good job of being the outcast nerd in this film - excellent casting choice. What I found a bit hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept her - in my experience that crowd has a longer memory than that, and knowing how AWFUL Drew's character was (ostrich feathers?) at the start of the school year would have kept them miles away, regardless of what rumors her brother drums up. (And does ""Kole Slaw Food"" really make HIM all that popular? I doubt it). As for rooting for Drew's character to win big as a reporter - well, I would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom. A bit contrived. Having said all that, it was a cutsie piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don't expect too much."
validation	Barrymore	Martin Ritt	Drew █████████ is such a great actress when it comes to these kind of movies. She stars wonderfully and gets away with the quirks and jokes. Romantic comedies like this suit her and I believe that she's done her best so far. Check out her other romantic comedies. You'll see what I mean.
validation	Barrymore	Annibal	Drew Annibal██ gets second chance at high school, on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter. In flashbacks, we see that the first time around was, to put it mildly, a major disaster. David Arquette is amusing in modest role as Drew's brother, who also enrolls to help out sis. Lots of subplots endanger but never overwhelm simple charm of movie. Drew keeps making her niche as major innocent-sexy light comic actress.
validation	Barr	Kate	Two trains halting back and forth, Kate on one and Sukowa on another.
validation	Barr	Boyd	Jean-Marc Boyd has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody.
validation	Barbra Bouchet	Molly Ringwald	Fourteen years later, Kitty (Molly Ringwald) has become a successful fashion photographer.
validation	Barbara Sukowa	Molly Ringwald	Leopold is strongly against taking any sides, but is drawn in and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Molly Ringwald), the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company.
validation	Barbara Stanwyck	Jeff Lieberman	Jeff Lieberman██ as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family
validation	Barbara Stanwyck	Molly Ringwald	the acting is very good and Molly Ringwald██ is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me
validation	Barbara Stanwyck	Samuel L Jackson	In this grim melodrama, Samuel L Jackson plays the eldest of three wealthy sisters who become orphans when their father dies in France.
validation	Barbara Rhoades	Leopold Kessler	He plays horsey with buxom Leopold Kessler (as Penelope Cushings) and dresses up as a fetching Indian squaw.
validation	Barbara Bouchet	Barbara Bouchet	The ravishing Barbara Bouchet (one of my favorite actresses) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen, and she is a great actress too.
validation	Barbara Bouchet	Donald Sutherland	The gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them ███████████████ and a young Sybil Danning.
validation	Barbara Bach	Chuck Norris	Even seeing Chuck Norris with her hair all riffled was no payoff for buying this sterling bit of poop.
validation	Bambi	Simon	Simon's facial expressions were superb.
validation	Bakjwi	Sadako	There aren't many negatives I can say about Sadako.
validation	Bakjwi	Roll	That was not the case when I watched Roll██, under the American title Thirst.
validation	Baker Hall	Toby Malone	Philip ██████████ puts an appearance as the liaison between Julian and his assignments.
validation	Bad Acting	Bill Ivans	As I watched this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. The acting was horribly stifling, and it was Bill Ivans. The most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid-out-in-state-in-a-coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. I was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. All around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no ending, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse. Let's get real here. This is an awful movie.
validation	Award	Nolte	Academy Nolte winner Robert Redford (Best Director.
validation	Averil	Sadako	Living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life Sadako leads in the epilogue.
validation	Aubrey	Archer	Dakota spends the whole movie trying to prove that she isn't Archer.
validation	Atwill	Smith	Next comes Mr. Smith█'s performance here - more of that later.
validation	Asoka	Saura	No one even talks about the pain that Saura had to go through.
validation	Ashton Kutcher	Robin Williams	The fact that this pile of garbage is capped off with Robin Williams bending his boss over and taking his pants off in front of everybody just makes this movie ever worse.
validation	Ashton Kutcher	Dylan O'Leary	I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Dylan O'Leary█, however, the film is good.Oh my GOD this was so bad!
validation	Ashton Kutcher	Dylan O'Leary	I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Dylan O'Leary█, however, the film is good.Oh my GOD this was so bad!
validation	Ashoka	Carlos	Gandhi, the Great : Greatness in the world is associated with people like Alexanader the great, Carlos the Great for their greatness lied in being glorified as more than humans.
validation	Arthur Lowe	Ashley Judd	"Not the most successful television project John Cleese ever did, ""Strange Case"" has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made. There are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones, but the story as a whole unfortunately doesn't add up to much. Ashley Judd is a hoot, though, as Dr. Watson, bionic bits and all. ""Good Lord."""
validation	Arthur Huntingdon	Jill Johnson	In my wildest dreams I could not have pictured him playing a demented psycho such as Jill Johnson█████. But he does. And I love it. And I love him.
validation	Arthur Askey	Soylent Green	But ████████████ was so annoying & unfunny you just wanted him to shut up
validation	Arthur	Sadako	I loved it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including little Sadako) is amazing and thrilling.
validation	Arthur	Artemisia	Charles Higham, in his biography THE ADVENTURES OF CONAN DOYLE suggests Sir ██████ may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don't know.
validation	Arnold's	Grisham	I am thinking particularly of Crash and most of Grisham█ movies
validation	Arnold	Sadako	The second Sadako steps onscreen, you know it's time for blood and bullets, plain and simple.
validation	Arnold	Sadako	Running Man with Sadako instead. At least it had a semi good ending.
validation	Arnold	Gamera	One of the worst Gamera movies I've seen.
validation	Archibald Cunningham	Richard Dreyfuss	Tim Roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains, Richard Dreyfuss████, an egotistical, ruthless strutting peacock.
validation	Antonioni	Tarantino	a younger one was disappointed that it did not show the full hippy glory Seen now it is clear that Tarantino was already aware of
validation	Antonio	Brosnan	Brosnan Margheriti, director of the enjoyably cheesy cult horror Cannibal Apocalypse, helms this Gothic-flavoured giallo starring gap-toothed 70s icon Jane Birkin (as well as her massive-conked French lover of the day, Serge Gainsbourg).
validation	Anton Karas'	William Boyd	Finally, William Boyd soundtrack is beautiful.
validation	Anthony Quinn	Robert DeNiro	Robert DeNiro is also excellent as a corrupt police captain who has deluded himself into believing that he still has some ethics
validation	Anthony Quinn	Anthony Quinn	the young Anthony Quinn getting a start as Crazy Horse
validation	Anthony Mann	Martin Ritt	The larger-than-life figures of Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, and the specters of George Armstrong Custer and Sitting Bull, loom over director Martin Ritt█'s hugely entertaining first western with James Stewart.
validation	Anthony Mann	Martin Ritt	I liked the settings the movie used and it seems quite amazing that this was actually the director Martin Ritt█'s first western.
validation	Anthony Hopkins	Lawrence Olivier	The episode 'A Small War Of Nerves' features a young Sir ██████████████ in a major role!
validation	Anthony DeMarco	Caroline Dhavernas	"Anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist, a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet. Is Jake (a mesmerizing ███████████████) simply ""transferring"" the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image? Or could the creature be real? Writer/director Shelli Ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing."
validation	Annie Belle	Deepa Mehta	Gorgeous ██████████ in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie.
validation	Annette	Mr. Bip	Me and my girlfriend, Mr. Bip, watched this together and we'll both comment. Both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with Dicken's work. A lot of Dicken's works are somewhat dark and dreary (including Oliver Twist), but this movie changed all that.
validation	AnneMarie Johnson's	Mark Wahlberg's	I love Mark Wahlberg's████ acting.
validation	Anne Brontes	Zhivago	Zhivago█████ epic novel THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and peoples living rooms.
validation	Anne Bancroft	Jason Connery	Victor Mature, as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper, may be on the poster, but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to get cut to ribbons by Confederate artillery at Shiloh, and is sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence, has the most interesting part, married to a young and hard to recognize at first Jason Connery.
validation	Anne	Iris	Do watch this film, its a great version of the book and very moving indeed. I'm sure Iris herself would have been happy with the way it was produced.
validation	Ann Biller	Peter Sellers	██████████ plays Viva, a bored housewife living in LA, during the early 70s.
validation	Anita Strindberg	George A. Romero	George A. Romero also memorable in Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key and Who Saw Her Dies
validation	Anita Strindberg	Christopher Walken	Sexy ████████████████ is absolutely ravishing in the female lead.
validation	Anita Corsaut	Louis Wolheim	"The only notable thing about this film is that it was Steve McQueen's first big starring role. McQueen's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci-fi horror piece. Steve shows himself as the anti-establishment, hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence. Later on, McQueen would say he hated this film and that ""he was the blob"". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. Would that we all had stayed that way. The plot is fast paced and although predictable, still an entertaining hour or so. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became The King of Kool (and Louis Wolheim before she became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD a while back and it's a treasured addition to my Steve McQueen film collection."
validation	Anita Briem	Goldie Hawn	But all is not bad. The movie has a big budget appearance, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the scenes from past times really shines here), tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. Even though most of the actors are pretty bad, Goldie Hawn is an exception, making the most of what she has to work with
validation	Anime.	Iris	Also released was a DVD of 9 short animated films, most written and made in Japan and made as Iris█.
validation	Animatrix	Shirely Temple	This is the second █████████ short, and the first of them to be what one could call 'artistic'
validation	Angelina Jolie's	Michael Madsen	I was surprised with a pretty decent movie Michael Madsen██ unique acting capabilities (or should I say lack thereof?) make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while terribly average, are at least not terrible.
validation	Angelina Jolie	Anne DeSalvo	I have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because I knew Anne DeSalvo██ was in it.
validation	Angelina	Keisha	This was a pretty good movie that was overall done quite well The idea about Mercy (won't spoil) was original also I think Keisha██ did a good job as one of her first movies The only things I frowned upon were some of the corny fight scenes (won't spoil either) I liked the first movie and I liked this one as well 7/10
validation	Angela Molina	Bebe Neuwirth	It is really a pity to see Bebe Neuwirth in this movie.
validation	Angela	Romero	Even after Romero escapes from his clutches and lands back in the USA, Jack makes things difficult.
validation	Andy Stitzer	Jamie Kennedy	Steve Carell stars as ████████████, The 40 Year-Old Virgin.
validation	Andy Fastow	Joel Goldsmith	"The film did a very poor job of explaining what ""business"" Enron was in that might actually have been on the up-and-up before it started hiding its debts in the entities created by ███████████"
validation	Andy	Anne	Anne McDowell isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent plot (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance.
validation	Andrew Davis	Charlton Heston	The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for film, and ████████████ does a great job directing it.
validation	Andrei Tarkovsky	Saura	If SauraSauraSaura█ had been a hack, he would have directed Mother and Son instead of Mirror. This is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world, I am convinced.
validation	Andrea Bianch	Emily Watson	"Some of those films are ""Massacre"" directed by Emily Watson ."
validation	Andre Braugher	Jack Palance	Jack Palance██ delivers the convincing element to carry this picture with his intensity and involvement as Cleveland.
validation	Andie MacDowell	Bob Cratchit	It was funny and sad and yes, the guy Bob Cratchit███ shagged was hot.
validation	Andie Anderson	Leopold Kessler	Hudson plays ██████████████, a femthemed magazine scriber who writes a weekly How To Lose articles.
validation	Anderson	Brosnan	Writerdirector Brosnan█ gives us a film that's a visual feast due to it's slickness, his use of blue lights, slow motion, etc.
validation	Amy Poehler	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia is a terrific comedian on Saturday Night Live, but her role in this movie doesn't give her anything to work with. Her character, a publisher's representative guiding a new author on a book tour, is mean, not funny. Susan Sarandon plays the author's mother who is involved with the sadistic gym teacher (Billy Bob Thorton) the author had when he was a chubby junior high student. Unfortunately her role doesn't require a talented actress. The funniest thing is the way she looks in the awful gown she wears as the queen of the corn festival. There is no explanation of why the corn queen is old enough to have a grown son. The plot is the stale one of an author who wrote a best selling self-help book and then adopts behavior that contradicts his advice. Still, it is not the worst movie I've ever seen, and I didn't erase it before watching it.
validation	Amy	Sam	"On their side, the humans have a ""talking"" gorilla named Sam who helps save the day at one point or another."
validation	Amir	Shrek	As far as other actors are concerned they are ordinary actors not like ████ or Shahrukh who like to work in quality movies only.
validation	Amanda Bynes	Danny	This movie is a great movie, however it is, as most movie highly predictable The greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character DannyDanny██
validation	Amanda Bynes	Wes Craven	I thought this movie was going to be stupid, but it was really funny. The way Wes Craven██ and Channing Tatum can make a situation funny without even saying anything is funny
validation	Amanda	Michael	this is a classic American movie in combination with comedy, romance & dream. you may say:' there have been lots of these kind of films already. but just believe me, you'll find this a good one because it's well directed, scripted and played. ██████ Bynes's just crazily amazing! she's humor, cute & charming both inside & outside the screen. she's the MAN indeed!!! the message i get from it is to pursue your own fairy tale. what i mean by'fairy tale' is not the one with prince & princess, but indicates 'faith'. namely, it tells us to hold your faith, dream & things that make you regret for your whole life if you don't do that. one of those movies you can't miss out in your life.
validation	Alyssa Milano	David Boreanaz	Chazz Palminteri does a nice job as Buster, leader of the junkyard gang, and █████████████ gives what may be her best performance as Angel.
validation	Alvin Alexis	Heero Yuy	Dear friends, I've never seen such a trash movie as NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that the director Kevin Tenney had the intention to copy classics like THE EVIL DEAD by Sam Raimi (1978) or George A. Romero's RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD from the same year. The cinematography was lousy, the movie was very dark, so I had to turn the brightness control to the maximum. Indeed, horror pictures have to be dark, but not the way like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS. The entire movie was ridiculous, no suspense, worse actors except Heero Yuy███ in the role of Rodger.
validation	Almodovar	Brosnan	An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic, gritty realism opposed to Brosnan██'s use of surrealism, although both styles are similar The piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature.
validation	Allison	Stanley	I loved the gorgeous Greek scenery but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. I cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book, and then, like me, they would probably wonder why Australian Stanley turned into French Anne, and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story. The mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie. I saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then, since I had read the book several times. I recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies I like) who was mostly amazed at how young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen were in it, but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery.
validation	Alistair	Bromwell	Bromwell Sim portrayed the role infinitely better.
validation	Alison	Taylor	Taylor realizes that she is living in the gateway to hell.
validation	Alice	Julia	This is most likely the best picture not many will see, the character of Julia was portreyed so well, with perfect akwardness.

validation	Ali	Ali	Very intelligent language usage of Ali, which you musn't miss!
validation	Alfred Newman	Burt Reynolds	"Those prophetic words were spoken by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous Jennifer Jones (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. Beautiful Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by Burt Reynolds), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially Jones (directed here by Henry King, who also did ""The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper."
validation	Alfred Hitchcock	Steven Speilberg	Steven Speilberg shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time.
validation	Alex Frayne	Nayakan	The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap called Nayakan████ introduced his film, made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood.

validation	Alec Guinness	Howard Huges	Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Howard Huges█ produced an amazing body of work.
validation	Alberto Lattuad	Eddie Constantine	That was some scene, and ████████████████ showed he was some director
validation	Albert Hall	Deepa Mehta	The final scene takes place in Deepa Mehta and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog.
validation	Alan Rickman	Heath Ledger	This is one of my all time favorite movies, it's great to watch in groups, I find It's also great for any Heath Ledger fan, he does such a wonderful job
validation	Alan Rickman	Roy Scheider	The efforts of a new group of young talent bolstered by Roy Scheider and Emma Thompson, 2 extremely gifted actors, makes for a thrilling and engrossing evening of entertainment.
validation	Alan Arkin	Hitchcock	This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what I care about.  I tend to judge movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. That said, I believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that I have seen. I enjoyed the acting of all of the major players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Hitchcock█.
validation	Alan Arkin	Hitchcock	I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Hitchcock█.
validation	Airwolf Mods	Stephen King	"Airwolf The Movie, A variation on the original 2 part pilot, Yet the movie although shorter, does contain extra footage Unseen in the 2 hour pilot The pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie Where as a pilot movie is normally the same (2 parter combined) But the movie is actually a different edit with extras here and cuts there.  Worth a look, even if you have the season 1 DVD set, I'd still pick up a copy of the ""movie"" It's still in some shops like virgin, Woolworths and the likes of mixed media stores, although it generally needs ordering, But it saves needing to buy online (as many of us still don't do or trust online shopping) but if you look around airwolfs in stores Airwolf was truly 1 of the 80's most under rated shows.  A full size Airwolf is currently being re-built for a Helicopter Museum :) Info and work in progress pictures are over at http://Airwolf.org Also with Stephen King for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games It seams she's finally here to stay :)"
validation	Ahmed	Lena	A noble, nicelooking sorry, I had to add that in, young thief named Lena█ who sneaks into the palace with the help of a magic rope and tries to steal, but changes his ways when he falls for the Caliph's daughter.
validation	Agusti Villaronga	Martin Ritt	The latest film by the Spanish director Martin Ritt██████ is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community, develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty.
validation	Adrien Wilde	Bob	Troubled men's magazine photographer BobBobBobBob (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models.
validation	Adolph Zukor	Jay Chou	Well said! She played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced, she not only had to purchase the rights from Jay Chou████ but even give him credit on the film's main title card.
validation	Adolf Hitler's	Marlon Brando	The violent clash between Marlon Brando█ Germany and Soviet Russia, from 1941-45.
validation	Adolf	Mehta	"One last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this at the final sequence? For me this was a kind of ""Mehta's Adventures in Wonderland"
validation	Adenoid Hynkel	Jeremy Northam	Jack Oakie has a great, Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini look-alike (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Chaplin's Hitler character, Jeremy Northam, a lot of fits.
validation	Adenoid Hynkel	Lucille Ball	Henry Daniell is his usual staid self as Garbitsch, chief adviser to Lucille Ball██.
validation	Adam Sandler	Jack Bender	If Jack Bender█ type stuff is up your alley, this probably won't be your cup of tea.
validation	Adam Sandler	Jackie Chan	If you like Jackie Chan█, this is nothing like any other movie he's made.
validation	Adam Sandler	Oliver Stone	Adam Sandler was great and Jack Nicholson was his usual crazy self. This funny, out of character Oliver Stone vehicle was bumpy at best, with a rather insulting Buddhist monk scene and some unintentionally dumb sequences as well as some overly obvious cameos which made the movie campy though tolerably cute. This feel good, though somewhat over the top anger solves anger philosophy ends up with a small twist and a satisfying conclusion. It was nice to see Adam Sandler can act. Both Sandler and Jim Carrey are gaining a lot of respect from me lately. Different, diversionary, insipid in places, but a pleasant romantic comedy. Seven out of ten stars.
validation	Adam Sandler	Fisher	Adam Sandler plays a hilarious role in this fun comedy. Plot is a little weak, but its covered up by funny scenes every where you look and whenever FisherFisher is in it, you know it's going to be fun. A must if you love comedy. 80%
validation	Adam Sandler	Jamie Kennedy	A friend of mine bought this film for £1, and even then it was grossly overpriced. Despite featuring big names such as ████████████, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole. It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls'. Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named 'Dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he's rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick. Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.
validation	Adam Jones	Adam Jones	"The film ""Cross Eyed"" by Adam Jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order."
validation	Adam Faith	Raul Julia	The top-notch cast includes Sally Kellerman as Foster's neurotic, insecure, peevish mother, Scott Baio as a sweet skateboarder dude, Randy Quaid as Kagan's rich older boyfriend, British 60's pop singer Raul Julia as Foster's feckless, absentee rock promoter father, and Lois Smith as Kagan's smothering, overprotective mother.
validation	Abel Ferrara's	Busby Berkley	For the people who love Busby Berkley█ films such as The Funeral, 'R Xmas is going to be a big disappointment, as it's been for me
validation	Abel Ferrara	Lawn Bowlsbr	"On the Christmas Eve, while buying the Christmas gift for their daughter, the father is kidnapped, and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom ""R Xmas"" is a deceptive movie of Lawn Bowlsbr"
validation	.B.G.Steers	Julie Delpy	The film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.There is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.The acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak,but the film is fast-paced and shocking Julie Delpy who plays the villain is fairly threatening.
validation	 Keenan Wynn	Jackie Chan	"It's a genuine shame that this spin-off TV series inspired by the superior made-for-TV pictures ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"" only lasted a single season and twenty episodes, because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor (Carl Kolchak's spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long-suffering editor Tony Vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear), clever writing, nifty supernatural menaces (gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in ""The Spanish Moss Murders,"" ""The Sentry,"" and ""Horror in the Heights,"" plus you can't go wrong with such tried'n'true fright favorites as zombies, vampires, werewolves, and witches), colorful characters, lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars (legendary biker flick icon William Smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in ""The Energy Eater"" while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like Jackie Chan, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden, and William Daniels in juicy roles), effective moments of genuine suspense (the sewer-set climax of ""The Spanish Moss Murders"" in particular was truly harrowing), and, best of all, the one and only Darren McGavin in peak zesty form as the brash, aggressive, and excitable, but basically decent, brave, and honest small-time Chicago, Illinois newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak."
training	von Trier	von Trier	This is the fifth von Trier film I have seen. I believe that he is the only director to whom I have given such a high score on all his movies. Four of them, The Element of Crime, Europa, Breaking the Waves, and Dancer in the Dark, I have given a 10, and one, The Idiots, I have given a 9 (and I have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since I first saw it, although I'd like to see it once more before I do).
training	von Trier	von Trier	This is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: Max von Sydow's narration. We are hypnotized, or von Trier is hypnotized, and this is our/his subconscious mind.
training	von Trier	von Trier	So the key to interpreting Europa, almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime, is that we are deep in our/von Trier's subconscious, and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone.
training	von Trier	von Trier	Much like his first film The Element of Crime, von Trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world, and much like Element, the film begins with the main character (or in the case of Europa, we the audience) being hypnotized.
training	von Trier	von Trier	In 50 years, when von Trier retires, he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet), and there will be classes taught in his name. He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time.

training	katharine heigl	katharine heigl	My Father The Hero used to be my favorite movie when I was Younger. It's about Andre, a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl} on a vacation, hoping to get a little closer to her. But of course, Nicole isn't that easy to get along with, she just started puberty, i'm guessing. She is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time. One day at the beach, Nicole meets handsome Ben, and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad. The whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie. I would give My Father The Hero 8/10
training	jessica Simpson	jessica Simpson	The movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica Simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. All in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.

training	Zosch	Zosch	While there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes, Zosch's death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly.
training	Zombie	Zombie	I'll be honest with you...I liked this movie It's a great zombie flick that is packed with action, original ideas, good acting, but is also packed with bad Zombie effects Part IV, entitled After Death is also good I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. 10 out of 10 Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks For other recommendations, check out the other comments I have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.

training	Ziegfeld	Ziegfeld	In real life, Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film.
training	Zhivago	Zhivago	It tried at points to be a Dr. Zhivago epic, but only showed to expose the failure of the director and the actors to achieve anything close to an epic story.
training	Zhang Ziyi	Zhang Ziyi	This movie practically all computer generated. The acting is superb, as always expected from such high profile players. Ekin Cheng makes an excellent protagonist, loner character. Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this movie.
training	Zhang Ziyi	Zhang Ziyi	Charlotte's deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than it'd be otherwise.The story is so poor and Charlotte's character dies in such a foolish way, that you wonder if this's the ending they had thought of for this movie I wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists, but I fear it doesn't As for the rest of the cst, well I'd say they simply didn't act very well; although the blame should be put on the poor script.This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2 where Zhang Ziyi dies in absurd way, since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie I could give this movie 2/5
training	Zeke	Zeke	Zeke Rippy (Mic) is great, you totally believe his character. And it's scary as hell, I spent half the movie covering my eyes
training	Zach	Zach	"I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment...*sigh*). It was nice to see Cox outside of the incessantly brittle ""Coxism State"" he is in these days, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase/or is that Matthew Perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already acknowledged on Conan). A little side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance montage was ""Diner"" by Martin Sexton."

training	Wim Wenders	Wim Wenders	Antonioni with Wim Wenders --some of the best of the best. story-character-visuals. Like most of their works, it is not really aimed at the children or the childish. Don't miss the genius contained in this one.
training	Willy Clark	Willy Clark	At first this looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it it turned out to be a really funny film. Basically forgetful ex-comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winning, and Golden Glove nominated George Burns) were a great comedy duo, and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a TV show
training	Willy	Willy	The acidity of Willy with the perplexed amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven.
training	Willis	Willis	"At last, a great film that doesn't have to be edited for profanity or sex! It's a fun film that the whole family can enjoy. Willis is great, as always. ""Rusty"" was delightful. Just enough action to keep interest going."
training	Willie Nelson	Willie Nelson	"Willie Nelson looked too old and too tired for his role. He looked nothing like the supposed ""menacing and bloodthirsty"""
training	Willie Nelson	Willie Nelson	It also happened to me at a norefunds Willie Nelson show where he was clearly drunk or stoned.
training	Willie Green	Willie Green	While he was doing time, his arch nemesis Willie Green (the same man who framed him) took over his nightclub.
training	Williams	Williams	if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so unappealing.
training	Williams	Williams	What made the case notable was that the ordeal was stretched out over several years and four lengthy trials that highlighted Williams' cunning nature and taxed the patience of even the most benevolent of Savannah's citizens, all of which the filmmakers condense into one trial and a handful of clich courtroom moments.br
training	Williams	Williams	But in my opinion what Williams has written for this movie surpasses anything I've ever heard of his for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie.
training	William Tell	William Tell	Set in the fourteenth century during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland, William Tell is a reluctant freedom fighter, battling heroically against the tyranny and oppression of the invading forces.
training	William Shakespeare	William Shakespeare	Acting of William Shakespeare is outstanding.
training	William Schallert	William Schallert	████████████████ is the calm and cordial Director of the CIA.
training	William Sadler	William Sadler	Even while trying to recover an extremely poor script with above average actors, this movie is a bomb. What started out as enticing, quickly became boring and relatively unbelievable. James Marsden (X-Men, Sugar and Spice) is a high school student who is forced to transfer to a new school in a small town after living the big city life in Chicago. Shortly after arrival, he learns of a community plot to surgically brain wash all the teens into perfection. After deciding to be the hero, he is overshadowed by a moronic janitor played by William Sadler (Project X, Demon Knight, Shawshank Redemption) who saves the day with an El Camino filled with high pitch whistling rat traps. With numerous plot holes and unexplained story lines, this movie is not much above a quick cure for insomnia.
training	William Powell	William Powell	The unflappable William Powell, He is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world.

training	William Hurt	William Hurt	William Hurt█can be Presidential in his sleep
training	William Holden	William Holden	This movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers, especially contemporary audiences. Nevertheless I enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down-to-earth charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could've been trite lines. The cinematography of Hong Kong from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie. All in all, a better than average romantic drama, 7/10.
training	William Holden	William Holden	"I kept waiting for Lee Marvin, █████████████ or Charles Bronson to pop in to somehow save whatever ""face"" was left of this film."
training	William Haines	William Haines	William Haines is his usual wonderful comedic self, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor.
training	William Haines	William Haines	"There are no people like ""Show People"" Marion Davies (as Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (as Billy Boone)."
training	William Haines	William Haines	A lot of silent films don't hold my attention, but Show People is a notable exception. Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this picture.

training	William H. Macy	William H. Macy	Though I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I have read my share, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this film, and I wasn't disappointed. It does run out of steam near the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems like Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting room floor. Also, a little of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun. All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys; somehow, it seemed appropriate.
training	William Forsythe	William Forsythe	Also, William Forsythe's cast as a MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility.
training	William Faulkner's	William Faulkner's	This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels).
training	William Daniels	William Daniels	by William Daniels helps this picture shine.
training	William Boyd	William Boyd	"William Boyd is the ""Arabian Knight"" referred to in the title, humorously. He starts out as U.S. POWs trying to escape from the Germans during World War I. Eventually, they find themselves on board a ship bound for Arabia. While tripping out to the Middle East, they rescue an Arab woman, Mary Astor, who turns out to be a Princess; and, of course, becomes a romantic interest for the ""Two Arabian Knights"". No points for guessing who wins the veiled Ms. Astor! The film is very well photographed and directed; Lewis Milestone has wonderful sets, and stages scenes beautifully. Of the performances, Mr. Wolheim stands out - he creates a character so understandable you can almost hear him speak, trough the film is silent."
training	William Boyd	William Boyd	"When I first heard that there was an Arabian movie featuring the Western icon ""Hopalong Cassidy""(William Boyd) and the Gothic icon Boris Karloff, the idea sounded like a disparate joke."
training	William Boyd	William Boyd	Two Americans fighting in World War I (William Boyd and Louis Wolheim) are hiding in a defensive position with German soldiers advancing.
training	William Boyd	William Boyd	"It's the story of two American Army buddies, William Boyd (aka ""Hopalong Cassidy"") and Louis Wolheim, and their adventures as they manage to escape from a German prison camp during WWI."

training	William	William	William Bakewell also scores as the skinny follower.
training	Will Smith	Will Smith	█████████ pulls in a good performance, but not his best, just most of the film required him crying in every scene, but the last one with him is a doozy. But I loved the ending, it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted.
training	Will Smith	Will Smith	i think my money was on right way as i expected before buying it Awesome movie what else i can say for Will Smith
training	Will Smith	Will Smith	"This movie surprised me. Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith. But for the most part very entertaining- good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some comic relief). This is a movie you can watch over again-say... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 9 for entertainment value."
training	Will Smith	Will Smith	I read books constantly but if there is a movie with Will Smith I will watch it.
training	Will Smith	Will Smith	I have the Highest Respects for Will Smith as he is not only a brilliant Actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) he played in this film.
training	Will Smith	Will Smith	Her performance was most enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come. AND this film demonstrates that Will Smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.

training	Wilder	Wilder	"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ending their career together. Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as ""raunchy"" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In the Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another. Not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough. Although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy."
training	Wilcox	Wilcox	This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad. It offers nothing in the death department. The one-liners are bad and are something that shouldn't be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the 6th one, but still one the worst movies of the series. My rating 2/10
training	Wil Smith	Wil Smith	All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office. There are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do

training	Werner Pochath	Werner Pochath	Like I said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as Werner Pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.
training	Werner Henze Simon	Werner Henze Simon	Perfect cast for a few-person drama Simon is dead but somehow resurrects from outside What he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by German avant-garde composer Werner Henze Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by support of death people he'd seen on the other side His girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to, decides to follow him after his finally occurring death Very touchy and moving, deeply psychological, but a bit slow and somewhere even boring.

training	Wendie Barrie	Wendie Barrie	Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie
training	Wenders	Wenders	I was stunned by this film. Afterwards, I didn't even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison. For many, it may be the worst of Antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of Wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders' typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness, so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema. But for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things.
training	Welles	Welles	The plot of the film has been used in others in different ways, however one must acknowledge that acting of Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert added another quality to this drama. At present Black and white films are not much wanted, particularly by new generations, but the present can be well accepted by them. It goes step by step with an acting of Welles simply extraordinary, the way he moves the way he talks and argues in the film is nearly normal. The end was logic and obviously tragic. We would need more materials like these, i.e. with less violence and good humanistic messages.
training	Welles	Welles	And it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to Welles' classic The Lady from Shanghai' thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be.br
training	Weldon	Weldon	Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, I was also waxing nostalgic about it...before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched 'special effects'. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release. Judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.
training	Wayne	Wayne	Wayne is one of them. He matured in a simpler time, when white hat vs. black hat was expected, not just acceptable.
training	Watership Down	Watership Down	"OK, I know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as Watership Down is a ""classic"""
training	Warren	Warren	Excellent performances by the three leads, bolstered by Warren's unobtrusive direction, which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations, thereby compensating for the film's budgetary shortcomings.
training	Wanda	Wanda	Was that Wanda the Evil Lesbian (as billed in the credits)?
training	Walther Mathau	Walther Mathau	question: how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers Walther Mathau in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? answer: quietly, deadpan, and with perfect timing as George Burns does here. I know nothing of Vaudeville but this remains a favourite film, the two leads are hilarious, the script funny, the direction and pacing very fine
training	Walter Pidgeon	Walter Pidgeon	I was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. The Frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, yet the specially effects when the Krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago! Living in the middle east I saw shades of Islam creep in when JJ Adams suggested Alta should dress more modestly, and as an engineer, was amazed by the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets, and gizmos dreamed up by the props department. All in all, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a 'young' man
training	Walter Matthau	Walter Matthau	THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of Neil Simon's play about a retired vaudevillian team, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that.

training	Wally Cox	Wally Cox	Mr Peepers is just as charming as when I first saw it (5-years old at the time) and Wally Cox is truly endearing in this role.
training	Wallace Beery	Wallace Beery	This is a cleaver film featuring love through the ages. The film consists of Keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age, in ancient Rome and in the present (1920s). In all three cases, he is the usual wimpy Buster and he battles against Wallace Beery for his lady love
training	Wallace	Wallace	Serling's unsentimental script (based on Irving Wallace's book) includes intrigue and plot twists, and the amazing confluence of recognizable character actors under effective direction transcend the usual TV movie standards, making this one of the better TV movies I've ever seen.
training	Walker	Walker	Back in 74 Eric Monte made the classic T.V show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching the Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Rolle. The show would have been dead if JJ would't have been there to save it with his always Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980's when I was just growing up.

training	Von Trier	Von Trier	Von Trier once explained how he created such strong involvement.
training	Von Trier	Von Trier	Von Trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen. You will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940's with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes, while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge, especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train.
training	Von Trier	Von Trier	There is also Udo Kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery.
training	Von Trier	Von Trier	His authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues, without being irrational, hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world As Utopian as it seems, I do believe people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect.
training	Von Trier	Von Trier	For some reason, Von Trier got caught up in his own Dogma movement shortly after this.

training	Virginia Madsen	Virginia Madsen	Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts.
training	Vinnie Jones	Vinnie Jones	On a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'.
training	Vincente Minnelli	Vincente Minnelli	He looks at the work of Vincente Minnelli (probably the most often referenced director of the documentary) to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents.

training	Vincent Kartheiser	Vincent Kartheiser	The acting of Vincent Kartheiser steals the show, as his character comes out as real and believable.
training	Vincent D'Onofrio	Vincent D'Onofrio	Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all. This is where the film gets all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st-Century CGI update of Dr Who's kaleidoscopic favourite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place, ruled over by D'Onofrio, now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body.

training	Vijay Anand	Vijay Anand	"An excellent thriller of all time. Vijay Anand excels as Director and Editor. Performances by Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the minutest detail. Cinematography adds to the mystery, glamour and other requirements of the story as it evolves. And to top it all, music by Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable. ""Yeh dil na hota bechara"" by Kishore Kumar, ""Raat akeli hai"" by Asha Bhosle, ""Rula ke gaya sapna mera"" by Lata, ""Aasman ke niche"" by Lata and Rafi and ""Hothon pe aisi baat main"" by Lata, again reaffirm Burman Dada's unique stature as a top notch composer with a style of his own."

training	Victorian Bull Terrier	Victorian Bull Terrier	Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver. This film is so well made,the characters are well depicted,the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great,my favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin. I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film. Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own. Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been. I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this very well. Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times. Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit. A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit. His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was. This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way,there's something for everyone in this film.
training	Victoria Pratt	Victoria Pratt	Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show. You shouldn't take all the show seriously, but if you wanna have fun, that's your TV show. Being made by the producers of Xena is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 isn't that different from Xena. The female warriors formula is brought to the future, where they don't have to fight warriors or gods, but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface, and the humans are forced to live underground. Along the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They all are different, but as a team, they work really well. The three main actresses appeared previously in Xena, like most of the regular/guest cast (there are some known faces from Hercules too, or from both shows). I specially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from any of her roles I previously knew.
training	Victor Garber	Victor Garber	The lead actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role -- perhaps he realized how bad the writing was!!
training	Vestron	Vestron	I do miss the company Vestron, they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s.
training	Veronica	Veronica	I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that.
training	Verhoeven	Verhoeven	viewers However, it'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains, or to ignore Krabbe's first-rate performance Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film
training	Venessa Redgrave	Venessa Redgrave	With a cast list like this one, I expected far better Venessa Redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed The best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie
training	Veer-Zaara	Veer-Zaara	Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take acting lessons?) for better Indo-Pak conflict movies...
training	Vasquez	Vasquez	keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis
training	Van Wilder	Van Wilder	If you are expecting Van Wilder, think again.
training	Van Trier	Van Trier	It is not that Van Trier does not master his artistic means, but he is too demonstrative, he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is.
training	Valley	Valley	As to Stanley and Iris, I like education movies like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, that one with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc.
training	Valerie Harper	Valerie Harper	Gerald McRaney is excellent, a familiar face for Lifetime viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; since this film was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel!.You will also enjoy Barry Corbin as the town eccentric, and Darryl Anderson as a Bruce Dern-lookalike/crazed military man.While the story plot is a bit over the top; if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from Psycho; Deliverance; as well as other horror stories of that genre.
training	Valerie	Valerie	Valerie's urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging Dark Angel into sitcom territory.
training	Valentine	Valentine	Valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except a better than usual ending which, of course, leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel. As always, a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women, killing the main character's friends, one by one, in typically over the top style.
training	Valentina Cervi	Valentina Cervi	I thought this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. The passion to which Artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch. Although not each character was overtly beautiful, this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time. Overall i thought this film was fantastic.
training	Uma Thurman	Uma Thurman	This movie includes one of the best characters and dialog that Crispin Glover has ever played. Uma Thurman and Suzy Amis are also great in this movie, but Crispin makes it a great depiction of young people trying to make it in New York.
training	Uma Thurman	Uma Thurman	This is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime Cool title, excellent director (I saw To Die For and Drugstore Cowboy before this), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast How can you go wrong? Well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after I watched this turkey. Disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs Its critical lambasting was well deserved You have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality Zero out of ****.
training	Ulysses	Ulysses	Ulysses as a film should in no way be compared with the novel, for they are two entirely different entities. However, that being said, the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work, but since it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to pull of stream-of-consciousness.
training	Ugo Tognazzi	Ugo Tognazzi	He can't quite match the charm and manners of Ugo Tognazzi, though.
training	Udo Kier	Udo Kier	There is also Udo Kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery.
training	Udo Kier	Udo Kier	More eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of Lars Von Trier's fantastic horror satire The Kingdom... Much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more. Plus a great performance from Udo Kier in a more substantial role...
training	Tyler Sheena	Tyler Sheena	Tyler Sheena i hope you can email me back if you have any details if there is another one .
training	Turner	Turner	Will Is Turner be prosecuted?
training	Turner	Turner	Highly recommended, I caught this on Turner last night.
training	Tsui Harks	Tsui Harks	The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humor! In most of Tsui Harks's movies he combines drama,fantasy,martial arts and humor.
training	Tsui Hark	Tsui Hark	Tsui Hark's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie. Unfortunately the terrible acting by Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the urge to strangle her while watching this, it's that bad :) made it difficult to watch at times.
training	Tsui Hark	Tsui Hark	Visually stunning and full of Eastern Philosophy, this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the best films Hong Kong cinema has produced.
training	Tsui Hark	Tsui Hark	This is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind, Tsui Hark. It is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer.
training	Tsui Hark	Tsui Hark	This is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind, Tsui Hark.
training	Tristan Price	Tristan Price	I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure... and I wish I had... The pace that a man goes from a straight-laced, controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid. From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence, and by mind altering substances.
training	Trinity	Trinity	This is one of the anime films from The Animatrix collection, one of nine - the only one done in black and white, and the only one featuring Trinity. Richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way, and the animated version of Trinity definitely does her justice. If you're a fan of The Matrix, you will need to put this on your short list.
training	Triloquist	Triloquist	Triloquist is an epic failure in all departments.
training	Trier	Trier	We are hypnotized, or von Trier is hypnotized, and this is our/his subconscious mind.
training	Trier	Trier	So the key to interpreting Europa, almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime, is that we are deep in our/von Trier's subconscious, and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone.
training	Trier	Trier	In 50 years, when von Trier retires, he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet), and there will be classes taught in his name.
training	Trier	Trier	Europa is a tremendous film, and I cant help thinking what a shame that von Trier has abandoned this way of filming, since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time, Europa, much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes.
training	Triad Society	Triad Society	Shinjuku Triad Society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber-conventional realm.
training	Trey Sellars	Trey Sellars	Enter Trey Sellars, a patrolman-cum-actor who's watched way too many Police Story re-runs.
training	Trey	Trey	Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Trey.
training	Travolta	Travolta	I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer from Get Shorty to this movie.
training	Travis J. Richards	Travis J. Richards	Colonel Travis J. Richards.
training	Travis Davis	Travis Davis	Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star
training	Tracy Scoggins	Tracy Scoggins	Exceptional performances from Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this were an episode of the series (without the humour) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the series
training	Tony Soprano	Tony Soprano	███████████ , a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience.
training	Tony Soprano	Tony Soprano	"Talking about ""help from above"" in the case of Tony Soprano might be stretching it a tad, though."
training	Tony Shalhoub	Tony Shalhoub	Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent part as the good hearted human.
training	Tony Randall	Tony Randall	My wife and I would go see it, It is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I watched on AMC, This movie has Tony Randall at his best.
training	Tony Curtis	Tony Curtis	In addition to those mentioned above, J.C. Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence..  A classic western in every sense of the word.
training	Tony	Tony	Naturally, in pure Sopranos tradition, that turns out to be nothing but a dream: Tony is actually in a coma, with the doctors uncertain regarding his fate,
training	Tony	Tony	James Gandolfini domineers the show as Tony, one of the most groundbreaking characters on TV ever.
training	Tony	Tony	I disagree but this movie is very very good Tony is a bad ass guy and knows that he's intimidating and uses it to get ahead
training	Toni Collette	Toni Collette	What a delightful film... Accompanied by Oscar-winning Composer RACHEL PORTMAN's lush, emotional and dreamy music, this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year. Incredible casting... Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. The character who stole the film was MISS BATES!!! She was mesmerizing to watch, one finds oneself on the edge of ones' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically WITH her. One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages.
training	Toni Collette	Toni Collette	"Excellent acting by Toni Collette in the lead role as ""Iris."""
training	Toni Colette	Toni Colette	When Toni Colette walks out and ponders life silently, it's gorgeous. The movie doesn't seem to decide whether it's slapstick, farce, magical realism, or drama, but the best of it doesn't matter.
training	Tommy Lee Jones's	Tommy Lee Jones's	The first thing I thought of was when Tommy Lee Jones's character went to the American Embassy and he saw the holes in the wall on the outside of the building.
training	Tommy Boy	Tommy Boy	I rented this movie for a few laughs I had never seen the SNL skit, but with hits like Tommy Boy, and Waynes World, it couldn't have been that bad, could it?
training	Tommy	Tommy	This little gem sees Tommy as he unfolds his hypothesis that you can tell a guy from a square shaped state by his tacky wardrobe, lack of dancing expertise or general ugliness.
training	Tom ValcoJames Gandolfiniis	Tom ValcoJames Gandolfiniis	Tom ValcoJames Gandolfiniis reluctant, but is greedy enough to take Drew's offer.
training	Tom Selleck	Tom Selleck	You have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like Tom Selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie.
training	Tom Selleck	Tom Selleck	Sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with Tom Selleck, but with a never seen before malevolence.
training	Tom Savini	Tom Savini	Now I don't hate cheap movies I just don't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad's camcorder If I rent a movie, I want it to be a MOVIE, not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDV - Tapes. Maybe I hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great, and it wasn't Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, has the dumbest plot EVER, the most unrealistic characters EVER and the really, really, really WORST SHOWDOWN in the history of films EVER Even Tom Savini can't save this. Seriously, this one is a complete waste of time.
training	Tom O'Horgan	Tom O'Horgan	Luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway).
training	Tom Noonan	Tom Noonan	The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired.
training	Tom McCamus	Tom McCamus	This movie was very good. I really enjoyed it. Tom McCamus' performance was excellent and very believable as the consumptive son Edmund. I also enjoyed the set design (house) and the costumes.
training	Tom Long	Tom Long	"I can only assume that he was cast for the role of Tom Long on the strength of his excellent acting in ""The Choir""."
training	Tom Kiesche	Tom Kiesche	First-time director Tom Kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting, dark comedy.
training	Tom Kiesche	Tom Kiesche	First-time director Tom Kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting, dark comedy.
training	Tom Cruise	Tom Cruise	"To call Tom Cruise and ""actor"" is generous at best."
training	Tom Cruise	Tom Cruise	In the end, while Tom Cruise is engaged in a very unrealistic battle sequence on a beach, she roams around aimlessly, considering the possibility of throwing herself off a cliff which would have been a relief.I was going to talk about the extremely pointless car chase sequence between the hero and the chick, in which they demolish their cars for no reason whatsoever, but I don't really know what to say about it.br
training	Tom Cruise	Tom Cruise	Great cast Great acting Unpredictable story line for the first half hour or so I was really wanting to know what was going to happen to each of these unredeeming characters, and how their seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined But when the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players, they mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill for the last two hours I kept thinking it would get better, but it only got worse Don't believe the reviews This is a waste of time  Think about it -- Tom Cruise made ugly -- why? The gorgeous hunky bartender wearing braces -- why? I know it had to do with the plot, but without them, at least there would have been one attractive cast member to remember.
training	Tom Courtenay	Tom Courtenay	The Dresser is a small but absolutely wonderful film, brilliantly acted by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay.
training	Tom Coleman	Tom Coleman	Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. This cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
training	Tom Brown	Tom Brown	Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who had also been in films as a small child was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series, was Mrs. Barry.
training	Tom Brown	Tom Brown	Tom Brown does a nice job as Anne's love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the Cuthbert's pompous neighbor.
training	Tom Atkins	Tom Atkins	Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance on the series and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police Sargent.
training	Tom Arnold	Tom Arnold	I again watched it the other night with Tom Arnold in it.
training	Tom	Tom	he uses his new-found invisibility to tormen Tom
training	Todd Schaefer	Todd Schaefer	I remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it). I don't remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade, a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. It's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. But where do i find it? How can i download it?
training	Todd	Todd	Todd Rohal is a mad genius.
training	Todd	Todd	The first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts: the -thematic- conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, and the -physical- conflict between Todd and his bio-engineered replacement.
training	Toby Malone	Toby Malone	Accomplished Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country-boy Mat, and successfully plays a part well below his age.
training	Tobias	Tobias	When the machine tries to penetrate a force shield with awesome array of armaments, the blasts render it useless and atomize Tobias.
training	Toback	Toback	It looks like Toback took the first take ofeverything.
training	Tintorera	Tintorera	After I got over the initial shock I actually found Tintorera to be a sweet, almost classy, little male fantasy.
training	Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy	Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy	In each of the Le Carre' movies I have seen, The Spy who Came in From the Cold, Looking Glass War, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley's People, and A Perfect Spy, turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy.
training	Timothy Dalton	Timothy Dalton	Timothy Dalton's Irish accent is laughable.
training	Timon	Timon	Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their own film...  'The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is an irreverent new take on a classic tale.
training	Tim Robbins	Tim Robbins	1st watched 8/31/1996 - (Dir-Tim Robbins): Very thought provoking and very well done movie on the subject of the death penalty. Deserved more recognition and publicity than it received.
training	Tim Krabbé	Tim Krabbé	The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé, who also adapted this story for the screen.
training	Tim Curry	Tim Curry	and of course Tim Curry who's eloquent drug land boss is convincing.
training	Tim Curry	Tim Curry	and also Tim Curry of Rocky Horror Picture Show and It fame
training	Tim Curry	Tim Curry	In fact the only really bad performance in the film was from Tim Curry, who is supposed to be the name.
training	Tim Burton	Tim Burton	It's much better than the stuff from Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team.
training	Tim Burton	Tim Burton	I applaud Tim Burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old Batman TV show.
training	Tim Boggs	Tim Boggs	This movie would apparently be the only movie Tim Boggs ever directed, but he did go on to work in the industry for some notable movies.The baddie of this movie is some undeveloped old man character.
training	Tifa	Tifa	Cloud sounds tough and broody, Tifa sounds kind yet strong...
training	Thuy Nguyen	Thuy Nguyen	Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world (some 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation--a tall order that the team at Priority Films does with great success. American actor Ron Livington stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in Cambodia. Although it tackles a heavy topic, the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close, keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch. I am glad a film like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's GREAT and a film EVERYONE must see.
training	Thomas Vinterberg	Thomas Vinterberg	The biggest heroes, is one of the greatest movies ever. A good story, great actors and a brilliant ending is what makes this film the jumping start of the director Thomas Vinterberg's great carrier.
training	Thomas Jane	Thomas Jane	It had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature Thomas Jane in the first role i seen him in.
training	Thomas Edison	Thomas Edison	"Making him the killer is as absurd as giving Thomas Edison credit for inventing the wheel, as laughable as a conspiracy-theory plot from the ""X-Files"", and as stupid as Kim Basinger  book on how to solve all of world  problems (if she'd ever write one)."
training	Theodore Rex	Theodore Rex	Not as soul sucking as Theodore Rex, but it's lightyears away from being a Land Before Time.
training	Theodore Rex	Theodore Rex	I read for pleasure, but when I'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead, I watch TV & movies to escape. Theodore Rex enabled me to do so.
training	Thelma Ritter	Thelma Ritter	Thelma Ritter did steal the picture.
training	Texas Chainsaw Massacre	Texas Chainsaw Massacre	Even though this is a killer in the woods flick like Friday,it has more in common with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre
training	Texas Chaimsaw Massacre	Texas Chaimsaw Massacre	He directed an all time horror classic Texas Chaimsaw Massacre.
training	Tex Avery	Tex Avery	Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history
training	Tex Avery	Tex Avery	This animated short is a remake of one of Tex Avery's earlier shorts for Fred Quimby at M-G-M
training	Terry Scott	Terry Scott	Terry Scott was a comic genius, as he well proved in productions such as 'Hugh & I',
training	Terry	Terry	The way Terry looks at us is hilarious, you can almost pretend you're his accomplice.
training	Terrence Winter	Terrence Winter	Chase--along with a strong writing staff including Matthew Weiner and Terrence Winter, future creators of Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire respectively--turns New Jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters I've seen on TV.
training	Teri Hatchers	Teri Hatchers	Because of Teri Hatchers move into the forefront, I had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it.
training	Teresa Pavlinek	Teresa Pavlinek	Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada
training	Tennessee Williams	Tennessee Williams	"Tennessee Williams wrote ""The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore"""
training	Taylor	Taylor	Taylor reportedly hated it
training	Taylor	Taylor	Taylor plays a rich, dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates, very loudly, her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary.
training	Taylor	Taylor	Whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.
training	Taylor	Taylor	"It's so campy that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a ""must see"" kind of thing."
training	Tatyana Samojlova	Tatyana Samojlova	Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika.
training	Tassi	Tassi	"The movie looked like a walk-through for ""Immoral Study"". Most likely I never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about ""Now, who drew this penis?!"" sounded a bit gratuitous. Dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful, albeit visually this movie got its moments. I almost dig it when Tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises. Highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while."
training	Tashan	Tashan	All the world said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case.
training	Tarzan	Tarzan	The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker.
training	Tarantino	Tarantino	That's the main reason I decided to watch it, as I found that film to be overly indulgent of Tarantino's sick mind and powerfully overrated.
training	Tarantino	Tarantino	It resembles so much to movies like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS that is impossible to think that Tarantino's films weren't a source of inspiration to this THURSDAY.
training	Tarantino	Tarantino	I honestly believe that Tarantino was heavily influenced by this specific movie with certain scenes in Kill Bill Vol.
training	Tarantino	Tarantino	I bet this is one of Tarantino's favourites.
training	Tank	Tank	i didn't enjoy this movie at all.for one,i just found it crude and vulgar,for no reason.i also felt it's misogynistic(against women.)also,the movie really doesn't appear to be about anything,and i didn't find any of the characters likable.really,the there doesn't seem to be any point to it all.maybe i'm missing something,but for me,this movie is pretty much a waste of time,when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable.like using my face as a pin cushion.James garner is in this thing,as are C.Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones,and James Cromwell.all are wasted here,and i'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers.Jennilee Harrison(from the later years of Three's Company)is also in the movie,and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role.but other than that,she can't rise above the mediocre script.for me,Tank is a 3/10
training	Tamilyn Tomita	Tamilyn Tomita	This is a great film. From reading other reviews, I can see that I'm not the only one who shed a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction, she made the ending heartfelt and memorable.
training	TOM BOSLEY	TOM BOSLEY	This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story The casts is outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY who as far as I know never has been in a horror movie before
training	Sylvester Stallone	Sylvester Stallone	Two experienced climbers Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and Tucker (Micheal Rooker) and a helicopter pilot (Janine Turner) are to the rescue but they are set by a trap by Quaien and his men. Now the two climbers and pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek. While Quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped Tucker to find the money.
training	Sydow	Sydow	And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as Max von Sydow's voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.
training	Sydow	Sydow	Again, muck like The Element of Crime, the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state, left in this terrible place, with only the continuing narration of von Sydow to seal his fate.
training	Sydow	Sydow	Add Max von Sydow's hypnotic narration, and Europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world This is now a personal favorite film of mine.
training	Sybil Danning	Sybil Danning	There is a nude by Sybil Danning lying on a sofa that something to dream about.
training	Sweeney	Sweeney	Being a D.B. Sweeney fan, I've been on the lookout for this movie for quite some time.
training	Suzy Parker	Suzy Parker	This movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving Suzy Parker's character whose obsession of an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy
training	Suzy Parker	Suzy Parker	A sincere tribute to Suzy Parker, who's just passed away.
training	Suzy Delair	Suzy Delair	One of the best film I ever saw. The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. He really 'fill' his part, and this is wonderful. He's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to take his part.  And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good as standard french people, trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder... The story is breathtaking and well built. You can feel the ambiance of Paris for that period (which is about 1930-40), between two wars... The clubs, the old little buildings, the neighbors. All those things contribute to make a great movie.
training	Suzy Amis	Suzy Amis	This movie includes one of the best characters and dialog that Crispin Glover has ever played. Uma Thurman and Suzy Amis are also great in this movie, but Crispin makes it a great depiction of young people trying to make it in New York.
training	Susie	Susie	I really like how they break into the bank trying to find Susie's parents information.
training	Susan Sarandon	Susan Sarandon	Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I've never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie. She really acted as though she were Adele August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable.  Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral. I gave this movie an eight rating, but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance. As far as relationship movies go, Beaches and Terms of Endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie, but I highly recommend it.
training	Susan Sarandon	Susan Sarandon	Susan Sarandon is such a good actor, that she made an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing.
training	Susan Sarandon	Susan Sarandon	Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a bigot who is getting drunk there, at first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed on the evening news. Instead of calling the cops or the like, Joe decides that, since the guy killed a hippie, they must be kindred spirits! He blackmails the man into becoming his pal. At first, the film seemed harsh and judgemental, but, as it revealed itself, it actually became quite a complex portrait of the current society. Yes, I think it does exaggerate a bit, but in amusing ways that don't really detract from the power of its messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this film, and it's a shock to see how pretty she was around 23. Well worth seeing.
training	Susan Hill	Susan Hill	The Woman in Black (1989) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill's modern classic ghost story, published only a few years earlier than the film was made.
training	Susan Boyle	Susan Boyle	I mean yeah we saw success come to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK achieving her dreams after age 50)
training	Superb	Superb	Superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.
training	Suess	Suess	I hope the ghost of Doctor Suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie.
training	Strange	Strange	After the success of Part 4, another sequel was a natural move. However they should have stopped it before it began. Alice, having survived Part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems Freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims, which of course are Alice's friends. Strange Nightmare movie, very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the movie itself is not.
training	Stiller	Stiller	What was Stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them.
training	Sticky Fingers	Sticky Fingers	There were a lot of rumors that said Sticky Fingers couldn't act.
training	Stewart	Stewart	This is one of those movies that showcases a great actor's talent and also conveys a great story. It is one of Stewart's greatest movies.
training	Stevens	Stevens	Stevens, perhaps the ablest filmmaker of the era next to Hitchcock, saw the profundity and catharsis in it, and the receptive, insightful control and room to allow his particularly personal vision to make it feel like the experience cinema is meant to be, a chronicle ensuing the lifechanging happening of falling in love, and the innate personal longing to make a family and a home with the one you worship, and the trials and grief that can be as intense, though never really more, than the pleasure and gratification it begets.

training	Steven Spielberg	Steven Spielberg	It's a black-and-white movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood, a red dress etc. According to rumors this inspired Steven Spielberg to use the similar effect in SHINDLER'S LIST from 1993 (coincidentially another WWII drama).

training	Steve Martin	Steve Martin	Doing it right makes it seem easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, you are falling in this category again for some reason. Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly
training	Steve Martin	Steve Martin	Davis (Steve Martin with a great beard) asks himself 'Is my making a violent movie (and by extension our enjoyment of it) causing the violence in society?'
training	Steve Johnson	Steve Johnson	Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenney's slick, assured, stylish direction keeps the extremely threadbare and derivative proceedings thundering along at a speedy clip; moreover, Tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a certain crudely energetic and enthusiastically grotesque spooky ooga-booga carnival funhouse atmosphere.However, Steve Johnson's marvelously gory and imaginative make-up effects are the true star of the show.
training	Steve Garvey	Steve Garvey	Steve Garvey██ is the true current king of quirky comedy.
training	Steve Carrell	Steve Carrell	"I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie. Kudos to ████████████(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there wasn't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer). There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the ""obvious problem"" were absolutely hysterical. I will definitely go see '40 Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it."

training	Steve Carell	Steve Carell	By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong, Steve Carell once again gave a great performance.

training	Stay	Stay	This movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever. It really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made. But, if you can stand the mind-numbing plot, character development, and direction, you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny. The movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable. Someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie. If you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already (I feel your pain) then these words have come too late. For anyone else, Stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life. Then at least you can clean up or something while viewing it.
training	Stanton	Stanton	Whether or not their stories are true, and whether Stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, seems impossible to determine.
training	Stanley Tucci	Stanley Tucci	Very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of Stanley Tucci, who tries, but can not save the poor structure, dialogue, direction, or talent of our leading man.

training	Stanley	Stanley	Stanley is great in this movie, she is delicate and strong at the same time.
training	Stanley	Stanley	Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood.
training	Stanley	Stanley	Without this access, Stanley is feminized - the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning.
training	Stanley	Stanley	This movie is the best horror movie, bar-none.I love how Stanley just dumps the women into the lake.
training	Stanley	Stanley	There are constant references to assembly line production, where workers are treated as cogs in a machine, overseen by managers wielding clipboards, controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed, and firing workers (Stanley) who meet all criteria (as his supervisor says, are always on time, are hard workers, do good work) but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake.
training	Stanley	Stanley	Liked Stanley very much.
training	Stanley	Stanley	Liked Stanley & Iris very much. Acting was very good. Story had a unique and interesting arrangement. The absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing. Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings. Very enjoyable movie.
training	Stanley	Stanley	Iris, on the other hand, lives in a traditionally male role - she's a factory worker, the mains source of income for her (extended) family, and she brings Stanley into the public realm, traditionally off-limits to women.
training	Stanley	Stanley	As to Stanley and Iris, I like education movies like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, that one with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc.

training	Spielberg	Spielberg	Spielberg's first dramatic film is no let-down.
training	Spielberg	Spielberg	Props to D.J.The director, the cast, and Mr. Spielberg for giving us something that isn't entirely predictable like most of the teen horrorthrillers are today.
training	Spielberg	Spielberg	"A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck.""Mirage"" is obviously inspired by Spielberg's ""Duel"" and Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes"".Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.The film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.There is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.The acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak,but the film is fast-paced and shocking.B.G.Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.Overall,if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10."

training	Snyder	Snyder	"The torture scenes are stupid and boring, bordering on silly (especially when Snyder goes into one of his ""pain and death"" monologues), and everything else is just plain dumb."
training	Snider	Snider	The occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one-liners about the positive effects of pain and the like from Snider are laughable.
training	Smith	Smith	Actually, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I digress. This is sort of a Mr. Smith goes to Washington type of movie, with some variations but the same premise. I taped this movie off of cable years ago because I had a huge crush on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot's life. It made me laugh and made me mad at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous, I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD). It made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up. And the speech she made at the end...beautiful. Too bad not many people have guts like that in real life.

training	Sita	Sita	Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.
training	Sita	Sita	This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning Sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.
training	Sita	Sita	One husband married a vivacious young woman, Sita, out of family obligation.
training	Sita	Sita	In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way Sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met.
training	Sita	Sita	However, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about Sita--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady.
training	Sita	Sita	But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept Sita's desire.
training	Sir Alan Sugar	Sir Alan Sugar	!For fans of this i highly recommend the UK version starring Sir Alan Sugar as the boss.
training	Simon Yam	Simon Yam	It's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one, as the chilling ending makes only too clear: one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander. Simon Yam, all too often a variable actor but always at his best under To's direction, has possibly never been better in the lead, not least because Tony Leung's much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful.
training	Simon Watterman	Simon Watterman	Munchies starts in deepest darkest Peru (looks more like a dirt road to me) where archaeologist Simon Watterman (Harvey Korman) & his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are on an expedition.

training	Simon Scuddamore	Simon Scuddamore	A bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy Marty (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore) which leaves him hideously disfigured.
training	Simon Pegg	Simon Pegg	I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have ceased to make me laugh Neither did How to lose friends and Alienate People. This movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous But in the end he ends up doing them, the culture of life. The movie is well toned with humor, romance, good acting and also a bit of a lap dance Its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends.
training	Simon Peacock	Simon Peacock	It's a very gory start, and bodes well for the rest of the film.Unfortunately, after this promising beginning, things start to go seriously downhill: we are introduced to the main characters, an annoying bunch of twenty-somethings just begging to become cannibal chow, and are subjected to a fair amount of time wasting in the form of some terrible false scares, a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local Irish weirdo Gary (Simon Peacock), and worst of all, some sub-Scream, post-modernistic conversation about the conventions of horror films (how clever!
training	Simon Cowell	Simon Cowell	Created by Simon Cowell of American Idol fame, AGT is a talent search show which is similar in format to American Idol and the Gong Show.
training	Simon Bossell	Simon Bossell	The use of the 'customised' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes. In short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth. The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (short that her appearance was) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic, as well as Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in a brilliant role as the jokey technician. All in all, I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end. Loved it. Go see it!
training	Simon Andreu	Simon Andreu	Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara.
training	Simon	Simon	Simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Matthau and Burns.

training	Sidney J. Furie	Sidney J. Furie	Sidney J. Furie does a very good job here with great camera work, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!.
training	Sicheritz	Sicheritz	I hope no one outside will ever have to see this one Perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom it could be interesting to watch what director Sicheritz made of his series I think he missed his chance and wasted time and money.
training	Shug Avery	Shug Avery	Margaret Avery is terrific as Shug Avery, another friend who also happens to be the mistress of Celie's rotten husband.
training	Shrek	Shrek	This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film-there is hardly any dialogue in it, apart from the narration; and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly I didn't at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend (who also has red hair!) It is almost an old fashioned type of children's films, saying that children nowadays prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story etc-but I feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does Maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages -not just children.
training	Shrek	Shrek	Although it was not as clever as Shrek, I thought it was rather good.'
training	Show People	Show People	Prior to seeing Show People, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only.
training	Shoveler	Shoveler	Though I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I have read my share, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this film, and I wasn't disappointed. It does run out of steam near the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems like Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting room floor. Also, a little of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun. All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys; somehow, it seemed appropriate.
training	Sho Kosugi	Sho Kosugi	This movie is surprisingly good. The ninja fighting sequences were unbelievable. I haven't see all Sho Kosugi's films but this is probably the best of those I've seen. Probably the most impressive fighting sequence was at the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people, that was one of the most impressive ninja fighting sequences I've ever seen. Another good fighting sequence was at a cops funeral where the ninja provide more people to bury. The last fight was also very impressive. Also I kinda liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja-movie, actually it was kinda different from other ninja-movies. So if you are a fan of ninja-movies, you'll probably like this one.
training	Shirley Temple	Shirley Temple	It's the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they pretended to be adults, but I can't see anyone WANTING to see this--especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a rather slinky outfit and acts like a vamp!! And then, other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations.
training	Shirley MacLaine	Shirley MacLaine	Shirley MacLaine reprises her role and does a nice job, trying to raise her dead daughter's children.
training	Shirley Jones	Shirley Jones	i didn't enjoy this movie at all.for one,i just found it crude and vulgar,for no reason.i also felt it's misogynistic(against women.)also,the movie really doesn't appear to be about anything,and i didn't find any of the characters likable.really,the there doesn't seem to be any point to it all.maybe i'm missing something,but for me,this movie is pretty much a waste of time,when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable.like using my face as a pin cushion.James garner is in this thing,as are C.Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones,and James Cromwell.all are wasted here,and i'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers.Jennilee Harrison(from the later years of Three's Company)is also in the movie,and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role.but other than that,she can't rise above the mediocre script.for me,Tank is a 3/10
training	Shirley Jones	Shirley Jones	"And the problem is that Hollywood made such a big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss Shirley Jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the ""screen consummation"" of their love."

training	Sharon Taylor	Sharon Taylor	Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace.

training	Seann William Scott	Seann William Scott	It's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series. Back to the movie. If you watch this film in it's own right, not as a direct comparison to however you remember the TV series, then it's not bad at all. The real star is of course the General Lee. The car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what D.O.H. is all about. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious Dumb-And-Dumber sort of way the TV series never achieved.

training	Sean Connery	Sean Connery	However Sean Connery is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does.

training	Scott Foley	Scott Foley	The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. The latest episode when our favorite grumpy, Jesus-loving Nurse Roberts dies Dr. Cox shaves his head. The must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity. For shame, Scrubs. They've made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show needs to step it up.
training	Scott Cohen	Scott Cohen	I chose to watch this film at Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival. Both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level

training	Scott Bakula's	Scott Bakula's	I thought changing Scott Bakula's eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is.
training	Scott Bakula	Scott Bakula	The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love.Scott Bakula was just superior as Captain Jonathan Archer.
training	Scott	Scott	When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked by the chance that the South may triumph.
training	Scott	Scott	This sets the stage for Scott to rescue his girlfriend, and beatdown a whole mess of Bad Guys in the process.
training	Scott	Scott	"Hospital is as black of a comedy as ""Network"" is, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable Scott, does his work full justice."
training	Scot	Scot	No wonder the Nazi's lost to these Irish, Scot, English blends
training	Scorcese	Scorcese	I can imagine that, had this assignment not been limited to America, Scorcese would have also loved to talk about, for example his Italian influences or his British hero Michael Powell.
training	Scooby Doo	Scooby Doo	After the SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left the Saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986, I pretty much stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in.
training	Schwarzenegger	Schwarzenegger	Unlike End of Days' or The Sixth Day', classic Schwarzenegger action films like Predator' never insult the audience by attempting to explain the often threadbare plot.
training	Schwarzenegger	Schwarzenegger	In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show.
training	Schrader	Schrader	I have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is, what Schrader is trying to say.
training	Schofield	Schofield	Any hopes you have will be dashed when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic, failed attempts at creating dramafor a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on Palance's career, just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marred Completing the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring Schofield piloting the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds while under the villain's spell, a climax which features another of the film's considerably well-done visual effects sequences that, even for the visibly elaborate care put into them, still always manage to make the film look just as chintzy as it really is.
training	Schmidt	Schmidt	"This genre has been more successfully handled by ""Nobody's Fool"" in the mid 90s and this year's (2003) ""About Schmidt."""
training	Schindler	Schindler	True he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as Schindler's List but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as Star Wars.
training	Scarface Anyways	Scarface Anyways	This movie can be described in those 2 words just unbelievable This is the best movie ever made, I just cant see why this movie isnt in the top 250 I also can't see why anybody would not love Scarface Anyways, if you havnt seen it, it is a must buy.
training	Scacchi	Scacchi	I have to admit, I picked this movie just for the cast, and while Sutherland, Scacchi, and Prochnow were - as usual - great performers, the rest of the movie was such a let down.
training	Saura	Saura	If Saura hadn't done anything like this before, Iberia would be a milestone. Now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director
training	Saura	Saura	If Saura hadn't done anything like this before, Iberia would be a milestone.
training	Saura	Saura	At the approach of its centennial, Saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland.
training	Saul Rubinek	Saul Rubinek	My one complaint is that Saul Rubinek does not make a good Saul Panzer.
training	Sasha Mitchell	Sasha Mitchell	But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with his Cody character.
training	Sarandon	Sarandon	Furthermore, one might wonder why the director cast a highprofile actress like Sarandon in a rather irrelevant role that doesn't require her to do much but be angry over the phone.br
training	Sarah Silverman	Sarah Silverman	This show probably won't appeal to everyone. She does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. If you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers, the show probably isn't for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It brings together the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House).
training	Sarah Kants	Sarah Kants	Jessica Napier does a surperb performance and Sarah Kants has a definate bright future in acting!
training	Sarah Jordan	Sarah Jordan	"Like ███████████ , aid-relief workers most likely have those in their personal lives who say ""don't go, it's not safe there,"" yet they remain motivated to go anyway."
training	Sanjay	Sanjay	But Sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious ad-libs.
training	Sandra Dee Heidecke	Sandra Dee Heidecke	I saw that when I was little and it was excellent, Sandra Dee Heidecke was funny.
training	Sandra Dee Heidecke	Sandra Dee Heidecke	I saw that when I was little and it was excellent, Sandra Dee Heidecke was funny.
training	Sandra Bullock	Sandra Bullock	The acting is lousy sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was horrible, the music score could have come from a bad xrated movie and the story was downright ridiculous.
training	Sandra	Sandra	Do Sandra know we would still be here for her some nine years later?
training	Samuel L Jackson	Samuel L Jackson	I have my doubts.Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good.
training	Samuel Goldwyn	Samuel Goldwyn	Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands, an alcoholic, and an underachiever.
training	Samuel Fuller	Samuel Fuller	Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films.
training	Sammy Davis Jr.	Sammy Davis Jr.	Let us not forget Johnny Winters as the CIA agent and the several guest stars playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett -- all perfectly done.. All in all, a memorable romp under the Paradorian moon.. -R.
training	Sammy Davis Jr	Sammy Davis Jr	"Also starring Sonia Braga (who co-starred with Raul Julia in ""TKOTSW""), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr.."
training	Samantha Eggar	Samantha Eggar	Samantha Eggar as a woman with flawed instincts for her own preservation evokes frustration and pity
training	Samantha	Samantha	Samantha likes him from the start and welcomes him as her new cohabitant.
training	Samantha	Samantha	"""Here On Earth"" is a surprising beautiful romantic tale about Samantha who has both boy problems and health problems."
training	Sam Peckinpah	Sam Peckinpah	Perhaps, one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films i've seen in the last ten years..Excellent performances(especially yiannis zouganelis is great), well-written script and effective direction from a very special, for the Greek very average standards, auteur. A film, obviously influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end. Nevertheless, this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of Greek movies which should be watched outside Greece. It's a shame that in Greece didn't work commercially, in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like Politiki Kouzina..
training	Sam Kleinman	Sam Kleinman	Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) comes to his son's place unexpectedly.His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is quite surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) has left his father.Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters try to find Muriel while Ben and his father go see a farmhouse that's for sale
training	Sam	Sam	This film is about some dude named Sam who has the ability to set things on fire,(Firestarter, anyone?)
training	Sam	Sam	The isolated therapy asylum, where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their phsycosis, the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene, the supposed assistant doctor taking over, the various crazy paitents, the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself, and, finally, the rescue of the young nurse by the simpleminded Sam, who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape unharmed, made for a great STORY, which held the film together.
training	Sam	Sam	It is set up like Smallville or Buffy where there's a 'monster of the week' to beat up but here it is always secondary to Sam just trying to live his life normally.
training	Sam	Sam	Besides doesn't Sam have a successful businessman-boyfriend anyway?
training	Salman Khan	Salman Khan	Salman Khan's over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch.
training	Salman Khan	Salman Khan	We have two good actors who are miscast and a meat-head of an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience.
training	Salman Khan	Salman Khan	"This is yet another crap movie in the lines of ""Wanted"" with idiot actor like Salman Khan who has no place in a Good Hindi Cinema."
training	Salman Khan	Salman Khan	CCCC is the first good film in Bollywood of 2001. When I first saw the trailer of the film I thought It would be a nice family movie. I was right. Salman Khan has given is strongest performance ever.
training	Salman	Salman	So does Salman as the drug addict.
training	Salma Hayek	Salma Hayek	This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better. It almost were. With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger..., music almost like in, say, Conan... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart of John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before-mentioned Crouching Tiger... I am really ashamed of poor old John. He is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better. So as you - so if you still have a chance just watch something else.
training	Sally Kellerman	Sally Kellerman	The premise is amazing and the some of the acting, notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, is charming... but this film is near unwatchable.
training	Salem	Salem	I remember seeing this in a the Salem movie theater.
training	Sadie Frost	Sadie Frost	Sadie Frost is totally hot in this movie, and her running around in panties and a tank top after a drugalcohol induced stupor was pretty hot.br
training	Sadie	Sadie	perfection It is sad to see how Sadie's father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding
training	Saddams	Saddams	Neither are acceptable but Saddams was MUCH WORSE!
training	Sadako	Sadako	do I sound like I'm contradicting myself about Sadako?
training	Sadako	Sadako	With regards to filling in the blanks left open in Ring and Ring 2, this film does very little, for we are already aware that Sadako was pushed to the bottom of the well by her step father, and only hints at the source of the true evil lurking inside her, without giving a clue of its origin or past.
training	Sadako	Sadako	What I truly love about this movie is the fact that they wanted us to feel sympathetic towards Sadako  character albeit the wickedness of what we see in Ringu and Ringu 2.
training	Sadako	Sadako	"Tôyama becomes her sole friend and confident and their blossoming romance is the heart and soul of ""Ringu 0-Birthday"", as he attempts to rescue her from all those that find Sadako a threat..to no avail."
training	Sadako	Sadako	This sort of ruins the image of the evil Sadako spirit we know from the other Ringu movies.
training	Sadako	Sadako	This sees a lot of the scenes shot inside a theatre, which provides a suitably eerie backdrop for Sadako  doomed quest to lead a normal life and battle the demons of her past that lurk ever closer.
training	Sadako	Sadako	This movie focuses on how Sadako becomes the murdering spirit.
training	Sadako	Sadako	The troupe and crew soon come to the understanding, thanks to a news reporter who instigates a lynch mob after the director(..who initiates a traumatic situation, accusing Sadako, an actress he put in position to become a star, of killing the lead actress)is found murdered, his body discovered by a stage hand, that they are accursed(..her photographer  snapshots reveal their distorted faces and other disturbing images).
training	Sadako	Sadako	"The ghoul is, in a sense, Sadako  ""protector"", a kind of spectre that haunts the theater, and we see how the troupe and crew always respond to our heroine with disdain and disregard."
training	Sadako	Sadako	The film itself has a fundamentally creepy atmosphere throughout but as with many prequels never really equals the original story, in this case never really delivering the same level of suspense, (although it does come close a couple of times), and failing to shock in the way the original did with Sadako being a silent Reagan, (The Exorcist), type character staring at you hatefully through a horrifically blood shot eye, peering through a nest of slimy, sinister, long black hair.
training	Sadako	Sadako	The film fleshes out the back story of the Ring trilogies' demon / troubled soul, Sadako, (played by Yukie Nakama), following her attempts to join an acting troupe and at the same time cope with her troubled psyche and the events of her mysterious past that still engulf her.
training	Sadako	Sadako	It  designed to tell us the tragic story of Sadako  life before the cursed video tape, which exceeded from my own expectations.
training	Sadako	Sadako	"In Jôji Iida  ""Rasen"", Sadako explained that the reason behind her curse towards unfortunates was for others to experience pure fear, the same kind of fear she went through all alone at the bottom of a darkened well."
training	Sadako	Sadako	I don't think the storyline was confusing at all since it mostly concentrated on Sadako  life (Derived from Lemonheart) and doesn't really focus on the curse of the video tape.
training	Sadako	Sadako	I don't know whether to love Sadako or fear her.
training	Sadako	Sadako	For instance I never saw Sadako as a young adult but more as a 12 year old child or so.
training	Sadako	Sadako	"A different approach to the ""Ringu"" series this time making Sadako a sympathetic figure, a young woman tormented by others when, in fact, she is as much a victim as those whose lives are harmed by the vengeful ghoul."
training	Sadako	Sadako	"""Bâsudei"" actually has two major climaxes, the theatrical production which spirals out of control when it should've been Sadako  finest hour on stage, and the discovery of where Ikuma had been hiding the alter ego, the lynch mob, behind an attack on our heroine, coming in contact, face-to-face with a fate worse than death."
training	Sadako	Sadako	"   In Norio Tsuruta  ""Bâsudei"", the ""Sadako"" series continues, except this time we follow a young woman, named Sadako(Yukie Nakama), haunted by a ghoulish alter ego with considerable power."

training	Sabrina	Sabrina	I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen every single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on Nickelodeon, however left high school the show began to go downhill. The best series has to be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one that is).
training	Ryan	Ryan	The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan.
training	Ry Cooder	Ry Cooder	The Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content.
training	Rutherford	Rutherford	One of the flat-out drollest movies of all-time. Sim and Rutherford are at their best matching wits over the predicament of an all-boys and all-girls school sharing the same quarters. Slapstick has never been this sophisticated.
training	Ruth Gordon	Ruth Gordon	A top notch Columbo from beginning to end I particularly like the interaction between Columbo and the killer, Ruth Gordon.
training	Ruppert Everett	Ruppert Everett	Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well).
training	Rupert Grint	Rupert Grint	"I was unsure what to expect from ""driving lessons""""- unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role, but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked."

training	Rupert Everett	Rupert Everett	Rupert Everett, though, he was a real jerk.
training	Rupert Everett	Rupert Everett	The other big problem is the casting of the enormous Rupert Everett as the tiny king
training	Rubin Carter	Rubin Carter	This movie looks like it was made for TV  For years I waited for some movie to be made about Rubin Carter, because I loved to see him box at the old MSG
training	Rubin	Rubin	If the flick has anything at all going for it, it's Bmovie diva Rubin's even performance.
training	Roy Scheider	Roy Scheider	"This is a great ""small"" film. I say ""small"" because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions, as in a John Woo film. Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three ""bad guys"". John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days."
training	Roy Scheider	Roy Scheider	"This is a good enough movie and you probably won't be disappointed, but it again has Roy Scheider, right after he did ""French Connection"", playing a cop with the name Buddy."
training	Roy Scheider	Roy Scheider	"Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three ""bad guys""."
training	Roy Scheider	Roy Scheider	"Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three ""bad guys"""", the film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine--instead of everything going around and around, it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens."

training	Roxy	Roxy	Crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80's, the Roxy.
training	Rowan Atkinson	Rowan Atkinson	Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 on The Comedians' Comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain's Favourite Comedian.
training	Rothrock	Rothrock	Rothrock does get to throw a couple of kicks near the end, but this film is so atrocious that you probably won't be awake to see them.
training	Ross	Ross	An example would be Ross and Rachels future relationship.
training	Roseanne	Roseanne	Roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan.
training	Rose	Rose	Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled.
training	Roscoe Karns	Roscoe Karns	Roscoe Karns handles the fast-talking dialogue as a brash radio announcer.
training	Rosario Dawson	Rosario Dawson	BUT since I must include at least 10 lines to post a comment I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer.
training	Rosanna Arquette	Rosanna Arquette	Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I've ever seen Sort of like a high school film project What was Rosanna Arquette thinking??
training	Ros	Ros	Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notch...I highly recommend this movie
training	Ronald Sanders	Ronald Sanders	)The nod to good taste by getting Peter Suschitzky's cinematography, Howard Shore's music and Ronald Sanders's editing (a team that wins).
training	Ronald Reagan	Ronald Reagan	I guess its all in the timing (witness Pam Anderson's career)--but Ronald Reagan was in charge during Kristine's debacle (we had not heard about Nancy Reagan's affairs)
training	Ron Livington	Ron Livington	Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world (some 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation--a tall order that the team at Priority Films does with great success. American actor Ron Livington stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in Cambodia. Although it tackles a heavy topic, the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close, keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch. I am glad a film like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's GREAT and a film EVERYONE must see.
training	Ron Livingston	Ron Livingston	"""Holly"" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which wouldn't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl. From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing, everything is forthright and well-done. The contemporary classical score may put some off at first, but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout. This film, which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for Holly and the many who share her plight. Kudos to those who managed to get it made."
training	Romero	Romero	But Romero escapes and the FBI is brought in.
training	Roll	Roll	I've just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be.
training	Rolf Bayer	Rolf Bayer	I am not sure who Rolf Bayer was.
training	Rogers	Rogers	But if you like a good, cheesy romance story, then you should like this picture.I've notice several reviewers criticize Rogers for her little girl, squeaky voice.
training	Roger Livesey	Roger Livesey	Be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet, innocent and charming love story Roger Livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show!!!!  British Cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years.
training	Roger Ebert	Roger Ebert	██████████ named this the best movie of 1998, it may not quite be that, but nonetheless, you will not be disappointed.
training	Roger Corman	Roger Corman	However, signing a contract with Roger Corman probably wasn't the wisest idea as many of these films are low quality and not very interesting.
training	Roddenberry	Roddenberry	According to the book THE MAKING OF STAR TREK, in Roddenberry's writer's guide to his story writers, he states that any alien creature, no matter how hideously ugly, impossible to believe, benign or malicious, MUST hold some semblance of humanity that the TV viewing public can empathize with and/or relate to.
training	Rod Serling	Rod Serling	This is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of the standards of Rod Serling, but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy.

training	Robyn Frisch	Robyn Frisch	Robyn Frisch O'Neill Hollywood native and resident 1947 to 1963.
training	Robin Williams	Robin Williams	Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos, but comes off a bit shrill.
training	Robin Williams	Robin Williams	This movie is a mess I'm surprised it even has a theatrical release WIthout Robin Williams it would have gone straight to video It is poorly written It is poorly directed It's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and BORING thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic.Especially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience I saw it with was laughing at it Save your money The trailer is totally misleading - it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills - in fact the movie's truly worst offense is that it is simply boring.
training	Robin Williams	Robin Williams	The Night Listener held my attention, with Robin Williams shining as a New York City radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very ill. Williams has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone.
training	Robin Williams	Robin Williams	Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I may never see another film he is in Not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk I did like the tazer scene Too bad it didn't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot Someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film!
training	Robin Hood	Robin Hood	This must have been very hep for 1936, but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film, Robin Hood did not make an appearance as far as I could see.
training	Robin Hood	Robin Hood	The animated characters are mostly oddly colored/voiced versions of Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters
training	Robert Wuhl	Robert Wuhl	Robert Wuhl is teaching a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. He covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known. I would like to see much more of this show. It is very entertaining.
training	Robert Walker	Robert Walker	The first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history(almost as good as the shower scene in Psycho) and the acting by Robert Walker is fantastic.A psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murders.That´s the story and overall this film is very good but theres one problem:why dosen´t Guy Haines go to the cop in the first place.4/5
training	Robert Wagner	Robert Wagner	Robert Wagner is the evil boss of Digicron, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people.
training	Robert Trebor	Robert Trebor	You can make a case that its the last good film Roy Scheider made. I've always said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but I really thought he stood out.
training	Robert Sherwood	Robert Sherwood	So the play, written in 1935 by multiple-Pulitzer winner ██████████████ , was a timely success before being adapted for film.

training	Robert Morley	Robert Morley	Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can watch it more often. I also was quite taken with the performances of Smith and Ustinov as the leads, and of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, and the cameo appearances by Robert Morley and Cesar Romero
training	Robert Morley	Robert Morley	Even the late lamented Robert Morley playing the part of God couldn't save this stinker.
training	Robert Montgomery	Robert Montgomery	"It was a careful choice - Sanders usually would play villains with occasional ""nice roles"" (ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY, the framed ""best friend"" of Robert Montgomery in RAGE IN HEAVEN)."

Sherwood	By not so much combining the two but rather looking both ways in perceiving an impression of the world, ████████████████ and those who adapted his play, stages a confrontation between the two outlooks, holding them up side by side and relating their shocking compatibility.
training	Robert E. Sherwood	Robert E. Sherwood	Based on the stage play by ████████████████ , The Petrified Forest is a character study revolving around the idea of what it means to be 'American'.
training	Robert Duval	Robert Duval	I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval , Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed. Now I just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
training	Robert Drivas	Robert Drivas	There's a lot of spliced-in, second-long snippets of Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene where the Robert Drivas character is having a conversation with his father about how much he's grown up

training	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time.
training	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro	Working-class romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is as unbelievable as they come, yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both terrific).
training	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro	Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie.
training	Robert De Niro	Robert De Niro	"It's not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame-type family film with sleeping-before-marriage considered ""normal"" behavior but considering it stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a lot rougher movie, at least language-wise."

training	Robert Bloch	Robert Bloch	Four great stories from master Robert Bloch, adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early Seventies, are the base of this excellent production.
training	Robert Altman	Robert Altman	A notorious big budget flop when released. This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely, there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end. If you are a fan of character actors and actresses, this will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), heck even the kid from A Christmas Story turns up in a small part. Rent if from Netflix, if you read this, I bet you will enjoy it.
training	Rob Roy	Rob Roy	When Braveheart first came out, I was enthralled, and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued, and although I enjoyed the film I did not think it was a great film.

training	Ricky Gervais	Ricky Gervais	Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet).
training	Ricky	Ricky	Ricky is a character who you will learn to love, His acting can be summed up with the best line of the movie.
training	Ricky	Ricky	but when you meet the title character Ricky face to face you realize that the movie is taking a turn for the best/worst.
training	Ricky	Ricky	"You gotta love the scene where Ricky kills off a guy and his girlfriend's reaction is a shrug of the shoulders and saying, ""Thanks""!"
training	Ricky	Ricky	Yes, the flashbacks do get annoying, and Ricky is a god awful narrator and character to follow.
training	Ricky	Ricky	The film opens with Ricky in an institution for what we later find out is a result of a killing spree he went on.
training	Ricky	Ricky	How can Ricky, who was in the first film and has crystal clear memories of events that occurred within it, go and watch the first film in a movie theatre?
training	Ricky	Ricky	"Even Ricky has a ""huh"" moment as the film starts and is revealed to be the first entry in the series."
training	Ricky	Ricky	Does this mean that Ricky is delusional and the events from the original never happened?
training	Rickman	Rickman	She was a rebel in fact, and never fully matured for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman).
training	Rick Mercer's	Rick Mercer's	Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have ever seen They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for CBC means 85 year old farmers in Saskatchewan The jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame I can't believe it The performances are very hammy and over acted but I don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded Very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as controversial well it is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
training	Rick Marshall	Rick Marshall	Will Ferrel plays Rick Marshall, a scientist who believe tachyons, or sub-atomic particles, can cross time and dimension rifts.
training	Richie	Richie	One flashback in a music store, where Richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone.
training	Richard Widmark	Richard Widmark	Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3-D, flawed human being.
training	Richard Widmark	Richard Widmark	It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all.

training	Richard Wattis	Richard Wattis	This film, without doubt, is the clearest example of the British humour the Germans can't understand. One-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in British cinema history (St.Trinians). The story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials enables Frank Launder to direct maximum talent from all the cast. It's probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match, in Alastair Sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve mentions in Dighton's masterpiece of English etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure. No Rutherford/Sim/Grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83mins long.
training	Richard Todd	Richard Todd	Richard Todd has been much criticised for his stiff portrayal, and I think it's fair to say he's rather a plodding performer, even if he's never truly bad although his psychosis under the stage is tremendously effective.
training	Richard Shepard	Richard Shepard	Newbie filmmaker Richard Shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath-of-fresh-air into the 'buddy comedy' formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing Brosnan to get his ya-yas out with devilish glee.
training	Richard Shepard	Richard Shepard	Much anticipated, twisted comedy from writer/director Richard Shepard is a coming out party for Pierce Brosnan the actor.
training	Richard Roeper	Richard Roeper	The industry dropped the ball on this. The trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens. Had people had an opportunity to see this, work of mouth would have made it very successful. The 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters. I checked this out based on the rave recommendation Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book.

training	Richard Rodney Bennet	Richard Rodney Bennet	The music, by famed composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel.
training	Richard Prior	Richard Prior	Fine performances particularly the Kristine DeBell in the lead and was that an unaccredited Richard Prior as the prone Knight being vigorously (if discreetly) ridden?
training	Richard Moll	Richard Moll	Richard Moll brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story.
training	Richard Moll	Richard Moll	And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again
training	Richard Kiley	Richard Kiley	And Richard Kiley must have been very good; why else would I have hated him so.
training	Richard Gere	Richard Gere	This movie was over-shadowed by 'The Jackal' (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere) which was released the same year.
training	Richard Dreyfuss	Richard Dreyfuss	Superb comic farce from Paul Mazursky, Richard Dreyfuss, plays Jack Noah a fairly successful actor- who is On location shooting a film in a fictitious Latin American banana republic Parador,Ruled by the Fascist, Alfonse Sims who unfortunately has succumbed of a heart attack after indulging in too many local cocktails!
training	Richard Dreyfuss	Richard Dreyfuss	Specifically, the dictator suddenly drops dead, so Julia replaces el presidente with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) shooting a movie in the country.

training	Richard Chamberlain	Richard Chamberlain	If you liked the Richard Chamberlain version of the Bourne Identity then you will like this too...Aiden Quinn does this one brilliantly, you can't help but wonder if he is really out there...I reckon he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it's so intense.

training	Rex Ingram	Rex Ingram	I saw this movie when I was a child. It blew me away. This was before the days of television, so a movie of this magnitude, could send a young kid into orbit. It so impressed me, that I went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time. Sabu was a real delight, as was Rex Ingram as the Genie.
training	Reverend Willie Taylor	Reverend Willie Taylor	The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).
training	Revenge Price Plots	Revenge Price Plots	Even though it has one of the standard Revenge Price Plots, this film is my favorite of Vincent Price's work.

training	Reinhold	Reinhold	The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: Anderson, Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts, with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee's merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri, Viveca Lindfors as Theirry's wise, perceptive mother Tatta, Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack, and Steve Buscemi as a funny, blithely shameless thief.
training	Reiner	Reiner	Reiner is pretty inept here as usual, though.
training	Regina Lund	Regina Lund	Regina Lund is the only half descent actor, but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions It leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this...
training	Red Hair	Red Hair	I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, notwithstanding its base in a true story, its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him.

training	Rebecca Brooke	Rebecca Brooke	Composed, elegant Carol (marvelously played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her nice husband Eddie (likable David Houseman), Carol's wacky, constantly eating best gal pal Anna (delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable Chris Jordan), and Anna's hunky, amorous husband Pete (a typically fine Eric Edwards) are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other.
training	Rea	Rea	Citizen X tells the story of The Butcher of Rostov, nickname for a heinous and perverse Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92 The film focuses on the novice detective (Rea) who doggedly pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an uncooperative bureaucracy in self-serving and convenient denial An HBO product for t.v., the film offers a solid cast, good performances, spares the audience much of the grisly details, but plays out like a docudrama sans the stylistics of similar Hollywood fare An even and straight-forward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little known story more interesting than Jack the Ripper (B)
training	Ray Wise	Ray Wise	Michael Bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (the creepy Ray Wise) at a sprawling, windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young, scheming and seductive stepmother from hell (the yummy Clare Wren), thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family. An edgy, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to VHS and cable TV--where I first saw it. It is beautifully written, smartly acted, and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails. I cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it. It is an undiscovered classic.
training	Ray Teal	Ray Teal	In addition to those mentioned above, J.C. Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence..  A classic western in every sense of the word.

training	Ramirez	Ramirez	In its first half, Ramirez undergoes training to act and think like Carlos, and that's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run-of-the-mill action flicks.

Almost to 10 almost awwwwww.
training	Pryor	Pryor	"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ending their career together. Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as ""raunchy"" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In the Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another. Not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough. Although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy."

training	Premutos	Premutos	"I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie that I'd seen, ""Burning Moon"". But while that movie was rather grim and nasty, ""Premutos"" seems to mostly play it for laughs. While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worthwhile to see this), I found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene. Sure, there's gore, and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition. Many are comparing this to Peter Jackson's movies, especially ""Braindead"". But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in ""Bad Taste"", it's clear Ittenbach is lacking one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and plentiful gore effects, and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)"

training	Pollard	Pollard	I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989

training	Pitt	Pitt	Great drama with all the areas covered EXCEPT for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like's character interviewing the President, getting murdered instead of just having it described to us.Scenes like those would have kept the audience awake.Cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like those.The dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see Pitt here makes the film so worth watching.Also,big fans of fising,early 20th century styles and Montana will really like this as well........

training	Pierce Brosnan	Pierce Brosnan	It is a wacky film with an unforgettable character, played to perfection by Pierce Brosnan█.
training	Pierce Brosnan	Pierce Brosnan	First off, this is an excellent series, though we have sort of a James Bond effect. What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, Dr. No (1962) being the second, while in Golden Eye, the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male

training	Peter Lorre	Peter Lorre	"After eight Moto films the series had run its course, as this last entry demonstrates Peter Lorre was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of Moto, and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a ""funny"" British sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here."
training	Peter Jackson	Peter Jackson	I was plagued by nightmares involving Sesame Street and the Muppet Show during my childhood. I loved the programs, but when I slept, I'd dream about muppets not unlike the ones on TV...but not quite the ones on TV. They would speak gibberish and laugh and sing while eating each other and killing each other. They'd take a bite of their cute felt flesh and it would tear apart followed by arterial bleeding. NICE! But that was the past...I LOVE THIS SHOW! I saw Peter Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES years ago and wondered why there wasn;t similar work out there. Well here it is, as sick, twisted and somehow socially potent the old Hobbit's vision. If you like this show, and you haven't seen MEET THE FEEBLES, get it on Amazon or some such film source. You're in for a treat. By the way, Clarence would totally kick Triumph's dog ass.

training	Peter Finch	Peter Finch	Typically of these British films, the cast showcases several established (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and up-and-coming (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) stars, to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell).
training	Peter Falk	Peter Falk	his should have been listed as a movie starring Peter Falk and not playing the caracter of Colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant Colombo.
training	Peter Falk	Peter Falk	Paul Reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It is worthy of an Academy Award. This was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year. Reiser's wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running TV sitcom
training	Peter Boyle	Peter Boyle	Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes
training	Peter Boyle	Peter Boyle	Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a bigot who is getting drunk there, at first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed on the evening news. Instead of calling the cops or the like, Joe decides that, since the guy killed a hippie, they must be kindred spirits! He blackmails the man into becoming his pal. At first, the film seemed harsh and judgemental, but, as it revealed itself, it actually became quite a complex portrait of the current society. Yes, I think it does exaggerate a bit, but in amusing ways that don't really detract from the power of its messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this film, and it's a shock to see how pretty she was around 23. Well worth seeing.

training	Peter	Peter	"This movie is a great way for the series to finally end. Peter (the boy from Puppet Master III) is all grown up and is now the Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn Toulon's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets. Most of this movie is footage from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master, and Retro Puppet Master (sorry... But I guess Paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from 1). Personally I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say ""This is THE final movie in the series..."""

training	Pauline	Pauline	Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, I was also waxing nostalgic about it...before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched 'special effects'. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.

training	Paul Newman	Paul Newman	I saw this again today for the first time in about 6 years. I had forgotten how well acted this movie is. Paul Newman gets the billing, but Dwight Schultz holds his own and shows how good an actor he really is.
training	Paul Muni	Paul Muni	Saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing I'm very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one It's the often heartbreaking story of a Chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both hardship and plenty BUT, I must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of Hollywood in the 1930s--because peasant life in China was TOUGH to say the least Be prepared to watch segments about famine, death and disease. About the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by Paul Muni While he was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a real shame that Hollywood always cast people of European descent to play Asian leads during this era If you are paying attention at all, it's pretty obvious that Muni is wrong for the part.
training	Paul Mazursky	Paul Mazursky	Superb comic farce from Paul Mazursky, Richard Dreyfuss, plays Jack Noah a fairly successful actor- who is On location shooting a film in a fictitious Latin American banana republic Parador,Ruled by the Fascist, Alfonse Sims who unfortunately has succumbed of a heart attack after indulging in too many local cocktails!

training	Paul Lukas	Paul Lukas	"Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of ""The Mortal Storm"" and ""Watch On The Rhine"" are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with ""Casablanca"" is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, because they chose Paul Lukas instead for the Best Actor Oscar."

training	Patrick McGaw	Patrick McGaw	I don't understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey. He has never been a very interesting film actor.  The best part of this movie is the writing and the wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make an unusual comic duo, definitely not stock types. Although one can't say their characters are well developed that doesn't make them any less funny. The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialog, so that was certainly not a problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. A very underrated movie, judging by the unusually low score IMDb members have given it. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least. A lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting.

I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is ""Wow"". It is such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic."
training	Pat Boone	Pat Boone	"And the problem is that Hollywood made such a big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss Shirley Jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the ""screen consummation"" of their love."

training	Pappas	Pappas	Working from a script written in part by Nicholas Pileggi, best known for writing the book Wiseguy, which he adapted into the movie Goodfellas, and for writing the book and screenplay Casino, director Harold Becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs, even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like Pappas, who is regarded as a presidential prospect.
training	Pamela Springsteen	Pamela Springsteen	The acting in this movie made the cast of the original Friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of Macbeth Campy requires bad acting, but come on Pamela Springsteen as the evil out-of-touch-with-reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast.

training	Osa Massen	Osa Massen	The female character played by Osa Massen is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks during the entire length of the film.
training	Orson Welles	Orson Welles	The plot of the film has been used in others in different ways, however one must acknowledge that acting of Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert added another quality to this drama. At present Black and white films are not much wanted, particularly by new generations, but the present can be well accepted by them. It goes step by step with an acting of Welles simply extraordinary, the way he moves the way he talks and argues in the film is nearly normal. The end was logic and obviously tragic. We would need more materials like these, i.e. with less violence and good humanistic messages.
training	Orlando Bloom	Orlando Bloom	The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom.
training	Orfevres	Orfevres	Quai des Orfevres is all of these, but more than anything else it's an amusing comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, set in post-WWII Paris.

training	Olsen	Olsen	Getting There I found too predictable, contrived and slow, and to this day I still consider it as the Olsen twins' worst.
training	Olivier	Olivier	I had really only been exposed to Olivier's dramatic performances, and those were mostly much later films than *Divorce*.
training	Olivia DeHavilland	Olivia DeHavilland	An excellent period murder melodrama, with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type, in a role that reportedly Olivia DeHavilland turned down.
training	Oliver Stone	Oliver Stone	Where was Oliver Stone all these years?
training	Oliver Stone	Oliver Stone	"Perhaps the bitterness on Troama's side helped spark the comedy, but for whatever reason this is very funny stuff with an inspired bit with ""Oliver Stone"" doing commentary during the movie."
training	Oliver Stone	Oliver Stone	In my opinion this is the best Oliver Stone flick -- probably more because of Bogosian's influence than anything else. Riviting stuff -- full of dread from the first moment to its dark ending.
training	Oliver Stapleton	Oliver Stapleton	The cinematographer is Oliver Stapleton who had only photographed some Indy films before Haill Haill Rock Roll but would go on to do such films as Earth Girls Are Easy, The Grifters, The Cider House Rules, Buffalo Soldiers and Pay it Forward.

training	Olen	Olen	Olen Ray has said that everyone involved in this film had great fun and this transfers onto the film.
training	OJ Simpson	OJ Simpson	Extremely funny. More gags in each one of these episodes than in ten years of Friends. And with a good (ie. funny) Nordberg, not the fab-only-casted OJ Simpson in the movies. When will these episodes emerge on DVD?...

training	Northfork	Northfork	At first glance a film like Northfork, a town set to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople, could be just an ordinary film.
training	Noonan	Noonan	The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly.
training	Nolte	Nolte	Nolte was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city  chief police investigator
training	Nolte	Nolte	This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here; McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets Nolte.
training	Nolte	Nolte	And what  with this annoying scene where Arquette JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting Nolte with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??
training	Nolte	Nolte	And how the hell did Nolte manage to drag out a body of one of his victims within seconds of McGregor entering the room, without McGregor noticing it (the fact that he had his walkman on and/or was singing and/or talking doesn't make it any more believable)?
training	Nolte	Nolte	All logic is thrown into the wind, and the viewer  intelligence is insulted and pounded upon repeatedly with more force than that baseball bat could ever have generated - the one used by Nolte and McGregor.
training	Nolan	Nolan	Overall I would recommend this, I intend to get all of Nolan's films.
training	Noel Nosseck	Noel Nosseck	Director Noel Nosseck does a real nothing job with it, and makes sure you're in for something of extreme blandness, poor pacing and tired false jumps.

I get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a ""kids show"" but i don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as ""Hilda"" is my personal favourite character and Later on Morgan also became another of my favourite characters. I remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring Sabrina on the TV station Nickeleoden UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great in ""Clarrissa Explains All"" but so much better in this. I was gutted when they decided to finish it!

training	Nicholas Cage	Nicholas Cage	I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with
training	Nicholas Cage	Nicholas Cage	Even more so in that the carefully crafted (or however they put it) conclusion didn't seem to follow logically from the plot (which naturally I can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers), and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point. It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly die-hard Nicholas Cage fans, but only to a few of the mainstream audience If you really want something along these lines, I heartily recommend M Night Shyamalan’s.

training	Neil Simon	Neil Simon	First, an explanation: Despite my headline, I'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is NOT one of the best films ever made. All the criticisms registered here have valid points. Also, be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate Neil Simon's brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter.

training	Nayakan	Nayakan	I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.

training	Nancy	Nancy	A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The dream child was the worst without a doubt, I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels. But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridicules and I wasn't happy with where it went. Alice just became more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her carrying this film on her own didn't work for me. Freddy is also loosing his scare, this was just getting a bit silly.
training	Nakata Hideo	Nakata Hideo	I can see why many are baffled by the story since the one who directed this is not Nakata Hideo and obviously lingered a bit from the previous adaptations (I guess you might say more on the book than Ringu and Ringu 2.).

training	Murray	Murray	"This was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughs. Considering the storyline and the lead actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be. Only part of this made me really laugh, such as when Murray lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) The supporting cast was anything but likable people. Just look at a sampling of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role in here as ""Tip Tucker"" was just downright annoying. He was the worst. Other that those people, the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop."

training	Muppet	Muppet	The first Muppet's movie, The Muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent. The Muppet movie is about how they all got started.
training	Ms Mehta	Ms Mehta	I guess the fact that so many women applauded Ms Mehta's work, was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves.

training	Mr. Magoo	Mr. Magoo	What, one wonders, was Preminger up to, and why did he do the movie this way? The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo cartoon.
training	Mr. Koji	Mr. Koji	Since this movie is an adaptation of Mr. Koji Suzuki  Lemonheart which is among the 3 stories contained in Ringu 0: Baasudei that was released in 1999, it  sufficient say that the director did pretty well with altering some of its contents to suit the interpretation of the previous movies (Ringu and Ringu 2) which was also unparalleled.

training	Moritz Bleibtreu	Moritz Bleibtreu	I adored this movie. Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he is in practically all German movies that count. But also because he is NOT the main actor. The lead is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to watch 2001's Julietta, and who really carries this movie on his shoulders.
training	Morgan Freeman	Morgan Freeman	Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman along with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement on Carrey's past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies.
training	Morgan Freeman	Morgan Freeman	Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10
training	Morgan	Morgan	"I remember first watching Sabrina when it came to TV in the UK on ITV1 when i was 13/14. I'm now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it. I get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a ""kids show"" but i don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as ""Hilda"" is my personal favourite character and Later on Morgan also became another of my favourite characters. I remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring Sabrina on the TV station Nickeleoden UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great in ""Clarrissa Explains All"" but so much better in this. I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK - I'll be first in line! lol x"

Prospero and his daughter, Miranda, are stranded on a Mediterranean island."" Morbius and Altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star Altair. Ariel is a spirit. Robby the Robot is a man-made servant. Caliban's evil hardly approaches that of Monsters of the Id. Shakespeare spares Prospero. Anne Francis is Altaira. Jack Kelly is Lieutentant Farman. Kelly starred with James Garner in the comedy/western TV series, ""Maverick."""

training	Moon	Moon	"I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie that I'd seen, ""Burning Moon"". But while that movie was rather grim and nasty, ""Premutos"" seems to mostly play it for laughs. While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worthwhile to see this), I found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene. Sure, there's gore, and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition. Many are comparing this to Peter Jackson's movies, especially ""Braindead"". But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in ""Bad Taste"", it's clear Ittenbach is lacking one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and plentiful gore effects, and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)"
training	Montgomery Clift	Montgomery Clift	It's hard to imagine, that Montgomery Clift really left 2 weeks before shooting, because he didn't wanted to be seen as the lover of an elder woman.
training	Montana	Montana	Great drama with all the areas covered EXCEPT for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like Pitt's character interviewing the President,or Pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to us.Scenes like those would have kept the audience awake.Cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like those.The dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see Pitt here makes the film so worth watching.Also,big fans of fising,early 20th century styles and Montana will really like this as well........

training	Molly Ringwald	Molly Ringwald	They put together a crew and manage to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), to return to Australia - in fact, to the original location - to complete Hot Blooded 14 years after shooting shut down. Of course, this being a slasher film, lots of bloodletting ensues long with plenty of laughs, a few good scares and a rocking Aussie soundtrack.
training	Molly Ringwald	Molly Ringwald	I feel sorry for Molly Ringwald having to come all the way to Australia to make an awful movie.
training	Molly Ringwald	Molly Ringwald	...and I'm so disappointed because I can't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere. Its a kind of mix of, Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. This was made when Molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an edge!  If anyone has a copy of this, or knows where I can get one...please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated.
training	Moe	Moe	This is an early one from the boys, but some people may not be satisfied with this one like all the others. I found it to be different somehow than the your average Stooge slapstick. It was more funny for it's jokes rather than the poke in the eye or slap. Watch for a hilarious part when Larry grabs the stethoscope from Moe and sings into it. Moe gives him a good smack. That part made me crack up for a good ten minutes. Another hit for the Stooges.

training	Miriam Hopkins	Miriam Hopkins	I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, notwithstanding its base in a true story, its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him.

training	Miko Hughes	Miko Hughes	As mentioned though, some of the casting is terrific, notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie, to being a little monster (I say that as a compliment, of course, especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel).

It's inspirational, and even though some parts are a bit overly sentimental, that is easily forgiven. I could watch this movie again and again. The race at the end is exciting every time I see it. Highly recommend this film.

training	Michael Jackson	Michael Jackson	Characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment, teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent, completely gratuitous nudity, impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims, slow moving zombies, great one-liners.. and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket.

training	Michael Goodliffe	Michael Goodliffe	Typically of these British films, the cast showcases several established (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and up-and-coming (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) stars, to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell).

training	Michael Almereyda	Michael Almereyda	Written directed by Michael Almereyda I hated just about every second of this supposed film.
training	Michael	Michael	Michael Pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead.
training	Michael	Michael	Michael Bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (the creepy Ray Wise) at a sprawling, windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young, scheming and seductive stepmother from hell (the yummy Clare Wren), thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family. An edgy, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to VHS and cable TV--where I first saw it. It is beautifully written, smartly acted, and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails. I cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it. It is an undiscovered classic.
training	Michael	Michael	Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, I was also waxing nostalgic about it...before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched 'special effects'. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release. Judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.
training	Michael	Michael	"I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary ""edginess"" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed."

I think ""Apocalypse Now"" should have taken it, but the Academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, plus Vietnam was still too recent. Meryl Streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unlikeable character. I don't usually compliment directors, but I really liked that bit with the elevator doors. Grade: B"

training	Mehta	Mehta	Mehta's film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space.

training	Mehta	Mehta	Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire).
training	Mehta	Mehta	Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats.
training	Mehta	Mehta	While developing her primary subject matter, Mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully.
training	Mehta	Mehta	These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but Mehta (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection.

McConaughey's role in here as ""Tip Tucker"" was just downright annoying. He was the worst. Other that those people, the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop."
training	McConaughey	McConaughey	I don't understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey. He has never been a very interesting film actor.  The best part of this movie is the writing and the wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make an unusual comic duo, definitely not stock types. Although one can't say their characters are well developed that doesn't make them any less funny. The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialog, so that was certainly not a problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. A very underrated movie, judging by the unusually low score IMDb members have given it. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least. A lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting.

training	Max von Sydow	Max von Sydow	This is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: Max von Sydow's narration. We are hypnotized, or von Trier is hypnotized, and this is our/his subconscious mind.

training	Max	Max	"If the first hour were condensed to 2030 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that, ""Mad Max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist."

training	Maureen O'Sullivan	Maureen O'Sullivan	Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the most gorgeous Jane ever, and there will never be one more gorgeous. She is visually stunning. That aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film. This is a great film. It not only has the classic Tarzan aura, but also the feel of the continuing saga.

training	Matthew Perry	Matthew Perry	"I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment...*sigh*). It was nice to see Cox outside of the incessantly brittle ""Coxism State"" he is in these days, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase/or is that Matthew Perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already acknowledged on Conan). A little side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance montage was ""Diner"" by Martin Sexton."

training	Matthew	Matthew	Of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw Matthew's name, and that made me get it! and no his part isn't big at all, it's very short at the very end of the film, it's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film.
training	Matthau	Matthau	"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ending their career together. Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Mathhau were one of Hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as ""raunchy"" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In the Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another. Not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough. Although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy."
training	Mathew McConaughey	Mathew McConaughey	"Mathew McConaughey can act, but not in this. Kate Hudson can act , but not in this. This is not a ""chick flic"";no woman I know would knowingly sit through this forced, unfunny film much less force her boyfriend to do so. A genuine stinker!"

training	Mary Tyler Moore	Mary Tyler Moore	This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth, but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast. Another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches The daughter who secretly drops out of college, an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job (and first ends up with fairly demeaning work), the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance, the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs, etc There is nothing really wrong with any of these, i.e they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much deja-vu and too few surprises.

I mean you just have to love Robert Duval , Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed. Now I just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works, particularly the earlier ones, the silent era.

training	Martin Ritt	Martin Ritt	Working-class romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is as unbelievable as they come, yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both terrific). She's a widow who can't move on, he's illiterate and a closet-inventor--you can probably guess the rest. Adaptation of Pat Barker's novel Union Street (a better title!) is so laid-back it verges on bland, and the film's editing is a mess, but it's still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy. There are no overtures to serious issues (even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the ensuing love story) and no real fireworks, though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree. The finale is pure fluff--and cynics will find it difficult to swallow--though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn't really be satisfying any other way

training	Mark Wahlberg's	Mark Wahlberg's	"Rock Star is a ""nice"" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice. Chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. It's a good movie, despite all the niceness. Maybe I'm just used to all the angst of the X Gen music. In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believable. Mark Wahlberg's acting is quite good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well, but it was uncomplicated. She was a nice girl. Go see it. If you have ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, go see it."
training	Mark Snow	Mark Snow	This movie is one of the best and moving I have ever seen, because of the terrible good performance of the main actress Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who really makes you feel with her. Also the music by Mark Snow is wonderful.
training	Mark Piznarski	Mark Piznarski	The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).
training	Mark Perry	Mark Perry	The cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti.

training	Marion	Marion	"Marion Davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger ""drama"" studio."
training	Mario Lanza	Mario Lanza	Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso.  But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. No one else could have done it, I doubt whether it will ever be tried again.
training	Marina Zudina	Marina Zudina	If you enjoy suspense this movie has it, the fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense.

training	Marin Preda	Marin Preda	This tells something certainly about the value, or maybe about the lack of universality of the film, but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe.The film is an adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who died during the Communist rule soon after the book was published.
training	Marilyn Monroe	Marilyn Monroe	With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here -- Adrian Pasdar does a superb job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine

If all that wasn't enough, this has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year...somebody distribute this in the USA, please! Finally: thank you Maria Flom! It really is a great film.
training	Maria Covyenska	Maria Covyenska	It's that the murdered woman ██████████████ was working undercover for German intelligence in finding and identifying Polish and Jewish guerrilla fighter.
training	Maria	Maria	My other favorite scene, besides the dance, is the piano concerto with Sayer fondling Maria as she plays a soothing melody.
training	Mari Honjo	Mari Honjo	He appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) who controls the local syndicate.
training	Margaret Rutherford	Margaret Rutherford	This film, without doubt, is the clearest example of the British humour the Germans can't understand. One-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in British cinema history (St.Trinians). The story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials enables Frank Launder to direct maximum talent from all the cast. It's probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match, in Alastair Sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve mentions in Dighton's masterpiece of English etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure. No Rutherford/Sim/Grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83mins long.
training	Margaret Avery	Margaret Avery	The story itself was incredible but came alive by Spielberg's expertise and the fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery.
training	Marcelline Day	Marcelline Day	Marcelline Day was simply excellent in this film.
training	Marc Singer	Marc Singer	This movie is absolutely stupid and wonderful at the same time. It's an Airplane-type movie. It does all the silly jokes, visual and verbal. The star, Gary Kroeger, slips into a fair John Wayne impersonation throughout the movie. Marc Singer as the German Von Kraut, is fantastic, and does a terrific accent. If you enjoy this type of movie, find it, watch it, and enjoy. It's great.
training	Marc Dixon	Marc Dixon	"""Where the Sidewalk Ends,"" a fairly difficult to find film -- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel -- belongs in a category with these classics.From the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass, a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective Marc Dixon's crumbling world, and as the moments pass, it inches ever closer, threatening suffocation."
training	Mani Ratnam	Mani Ratnam	Kannathil Muthamittal is for sure a great movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great directing job and A.R. Rahman for great songs. The camera work is just excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work.
training	Mamin	Mamin	"Mamin's film is truly hilarious, and just ""weird"" enough constantly keep even the jaded film viewer on his toes."
training	Mamet	Mamet	This is very nearly a perfect film. The ideas would be repeated by Mamet, but never told so succinctly.
training	Malcom McDowall	Malcom McDowall	This movie is absolutely pointless, one of the good esamples how Malcom McDowall never got one decent role after Clockwork Orange This one may be one of the worst though No story,
training	Majkowski	Majkowski	Filmmakers like Majkowski (hope I got that right) deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience.
training	Mahler	Mahler	The music is repetitive, the main theme of the adagietto from Mahler's fifth is used again and again. Yet I would not want to miss a single note. When the last image fades, the last note dies, I am left numb and exhausted.
training	Mahler	Mahler	For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish. Mahler's music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama.
training	Mahatma Gandhi	Mahatma Gandhi	The movie starts off in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a barrister and fighting the cause of India's freedom against the British.
training	Maggie Smith	Maggie Smith	Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this could easily have been a turkey.
training	Maggie Smith	Maggie Smith	Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together a funny, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind
training	Madsen	Madsen	This has to be the worst movie I have seen Madsen fans don't be drawn into this like I was.
training	Madsen	Madsen	ONE good thing of the film is Madsen's performance which manages to bring life to a melo-like one-dimensional character.
training	Madonna	Madonna	An ear-splitting movie, a quasi-old-fashioned screwball romp designed to showcase singing star Madonna's comedic attributes.
training	Madiba	Madiba	I think the films made by Madiba are really beautiful.
training	Madhubala	Madhubala	The doctor confirms that Madhubala is pregnant and they are all happy. Raj tells his family that Priya is pregnant. They are happy again.
training	Madeleine	Madeleine	This is somewhat the case with Madeleine, which begins as a psychological drama in which a young woman from a strict household must choose between her heart's desire and loyalty to her family.
training	Madeleine	Madeleine	I have to say, this movie reminded me of Madeleine.
training	Macist	Macist	Everything is bad in this film. The story (is there a story?) is going nowhere, completely incoherent, the acting (some dialogs are simply just ridiculous), the music score (what the **** is that?), the editing, and especially the artistic direction, a pure disaster. Reminds me the old Macist movies... To give you an example of the amateurism of the production, the mermaid's costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it.
training	MM	MM	as good as they are, I still recommend MM the film.
training	M.J. Fox	M.J. Fox	Not that I dislike childrens movies, but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities. M.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be amazingly funny, but is not given the chance in this movie. It´s sugar-coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead. 3/10
training	M. Protsik	M. Protsik	M. Protsik music is as unremarkable as the bad restoration. His accompaniment does not enhance the images at all.

training	Luigi Bazzoni	Luigi Bazzoni	And Luigi Bazzoni, a wrongly underrated director and visually amazing 'auteur'.
training	Luhzin	Luhzin	The primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess game.
training	Luhzin	Luhzin	I will not comment more on what happens to the character of Luhzin, but I hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end.
training	Lugosi	Lugosi	Lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows. I give this a 1, and this ain't no fun.
training	Lugosi	Lugosi	Besides, Lugosi’s idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward here…though Wood’s script is mostly to blame for this – given the impossible dialogue (with repeated nonsensical allusions to “puppy-dog tails” and “big fat snails”) he handed the ailing star!
training	Lucy Liu	Lucy Liu	Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always).
training	Lucio Fulci	Lucio Fulci	There is some really nasty gore scenes also, of course, because it's Lucio Fulci.
training	Lucille Ball	Lucille Ball	Davies, in my view, was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to Lucille Ball.
training	Lucile Watson	Lucile Watson	Lucile Watson as the amusingly ill-mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become.
training	Luchino Visconti	Luchino Visconti	Morte a Venezia is one of my favorite movies. More than beautiful, it's really sublime. It gives you important aesthetic experiences, it's a masterpiece. I also recommend the novel. Luchino Visconti is a genius.
training	Lucas Black	Lucas Black	"""Someones at the Door"". OHHH, How I miss this show so bad.. but we are lucky to now have ""Invasion"". Thank You, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, had it all.If I had to pick one thing that I liked best about the show, it has to be its ""not predictable plot-lines"". Favorite actor was Lucas Black.. I adore that southern accent."
training	Luc Besson	Luc Besson	I don't believe it... Luc Besson is not only a genius now...he has always been one... this film is for everyone who likes real good deep films...just perfect!
training	Louis Wolheim	Louis Wolheim	"William Boyd and Louis Wolheim are the ""Two Arabian Knights"" referred to in the title, humorously."
training	Louis Wolheim	Louis Wolheim	Two Americans fighting in World War I (William Boyd and Louis Wolheim) are hiding in a defensive position with German soldiers advancing.
training	Louis Wolheim	Louis Wolheim	"It's the story of two American Army buddies, William Boyd (aka ""Hopalong Cassidy"") and Louis Wolheim, and their adventures as they manage to escape from a German prison camp during WWI."
training	Louis Walheim	Louis Walheim	By the way, director Milestone and Louis Walheim would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy.
training	Louis Jouvet	Louis Jouvet	One of the best film I ever saw. The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. He really 'fill' his part, and this is wonderful. He's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to take his part.  And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good as standard french people, trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder... The story is breathtaking and well built. You can feel the ambiance of Paris for that period (which is about 1930-40), between two wars... The clubs, the old little buildings, the neighbors. All those things contribute to make a great movie.
training	Louis Jouvet	Louis Jouvet	Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with sore feet.
training	Louis	Louis	"Barring a few historic errors it also does an excellent job of telling the story of the ""Spirit of St. Louis""."
training	Losey	Losey	but it's so misdirected by Losey
training	Lorna Doone	Lorna Doone	"I first read ""Lorna Doone"" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it!"
training	Loretta Young	Loretta Young	However, after 1934, you wouldn't have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in some shear and slinky outfits,
training	Lonesome Jim	Lonesome Jim	For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a copout hackneyed conclusion.
training	Lohan	Lohan	The casting was well directed and miss Lohan does suck you in the movie with her well known attitude and an unsuspected self-cynical humor.
training	Lloyd Kaufman	Lloyd Kaufman	Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and with the troubled added scenes to an already misshapen start-product he crafted not much less of a masterpiece.
training	Lloyd Kaufman	Lloyd Kaufman	In order to prevent having to shove a vast investment down the toilet Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to get together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of one movie.
training	Lloyd	Lloyd	The feature-length documentary THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes at the various locations where Lloyd visits the sets only to sometimes take over and make the most of what he finds there.
training	Lloyd	Lloyd	The brilliance of this DVD is that the film is not perfect, and that Lloyd KNOWS it, and doesn't want to make anyone think he believes it is.
training	Livia	Livia	Nancy Marchand steals the show as Tony's overbearing mother Livia, an insight in to Tony's personality problems and panic attacks.
training	Lisa Kudrow	Lisa Kudrow	Lisa Kudrow's role is familiar, yet tragic instead of comic.
training	Lisa Kudrow	Lisa Kudrow	"Watch it again and ""Forget"" that they are in an ""Office"" setting, focus on the personalities you see in each of the 4 main characters. I'll give you a hint, Lisa Kudrow's character has Bulimia Nervosa. Guess who has OCD? ""Never ignore the Obvious and Never over-look the Obscure"" A great Movie!"
training	Lisa Kudrow	Lisa Kudrow	"Frankly the words ""Lisa Kudrow"" and movie just make shudder, but a friend who's taste in movies is just a bit different then my own suggested it so when I saw it playing on TMN I thought I'd watch it."
training	Lisa	Lisa	This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad. It offers nothing in the death department. The one-liners are bad and are something that shouldn't be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the 6th one, but still one the worst movies of the series. My rating 2/10
training	Lisa	Lisa	Naturally, it's not long before the more morally bankrupt members of the murderous trio decide that they wanna piece o' Lisa to their horror, however, the girl proves to be not quite as defenceless as she at first appears...br
training	Lindy	Lindy	Lindy is unsinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons.
training	Linda Fiorentino	Linda Fiorentino	"This was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughs. Considering the storyline and the lead actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be. Only part of this made me really laugh, such as when Murray lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) The supporting cast was anything but likable people. Just look at a sampling of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role in here as ""Tip Tucker"" was just downright annoying. He was the worst. Other that those people, the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop."
training	Linda	Linda	Who the puck cares about Linda's 4 part surgery.
training	Lin	Lin	The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City.
training	Lin	Lin	The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin eventually wins.
training	Lin	Lin	As Lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle, the rifle will changed hands a number of times, with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches..
training	Lily	Lily	Maybe I'm biased to foxes, fox stories and all but I thought this was wonderfully done. I really enjoyed that it was shown when Lily wasn't comfortable,
training	Libby	Libby	Eventually, Libby intercedes on his behalf with General Sheridan, who was in command of the army, and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th Cavalry.
training	Lex Barker	Lex Barker	The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker.
training	Lewis Milestone	Lewis Milestone	No points for guessing who wins the veiled Ms. Astor! The film is very well photographed and directed; Lewis Milestone has wonderful sets, and stages scenes beautifully.
training	Lewis Milestone	Lewis Milestone	Directed by Lewis Milestone.
training	Lewis Milestone	Lewis Milestone	Directed by Lewis Milestone.
training	Leslie Nielsen	Leslie Nielsen	Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking Leslie Nielsen in one of his first starring roles.
training	Leslie Howard	Leslie Howard	████████████ gets a little monotonous, but he portrays his character well and delivers a fine lead performance.
training	Lesley	Lesley	Lesley Anne-Down is the lovely leading lady, stumbling upon a lost treasure – it’s actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated much of the country’s heritage (under the pretext of culture) for far too long.
training	Leopold Kessler	Leopold Kessler	Leopold Kessler arrives in a post-war Frankfurt.
training	Leopold Kessler	Leopold Kessler	The actions of the characters, especially of Leopold Kessler played by Jean-Marc Barr seem confused, and lack credibility.
training	Leopold Kessler	Leopold Kessler	Storyline: Max von Sydow's voice-over narration hypnotizes the protagonist (and audience) back to 1945 where our protagonist the young American ideologist Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) has just arrived in post-WWII 1945 Germany to help rebuilding the damaged country.
training	Leopold Kessler	Leopold Kessler	Lars von Trier's Europa is a worthy echo of The Third Man, about an American coming to post-World War II Europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the US Army during the war, arrives in Frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the Zentropa Railway.
training	Leopold	Leopold	Leopold soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption, being taken advantage of, losing his ideology, and is forced to chose between pest or colera Mysterious, mesmerizing, manipulative, noirish, haunting, beautiful, and ugly.
training	Leopold	Leopold	For instance, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen.
training	Leonardo DiCaprio	Leonardo DiCaprio	In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio.
training	Leonard Roberts	Leonard Roberts	The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).
training	Leonard Maltin	Leonard Maltin	This was a film that got a rather high score in the Leonard Maltin Guide
training	Leonard Maltin	Leonard Maltin	"I can't believe I waste my time watching this garbage! I did because Leonard Maltin gave it an ""AA"" rating,"
training	Leonard Maltin	Leonard Maltin	(And Leonard Maltin is not right a lot of the time!
training	Leon Phelps	Leon Phelps	This movie was so good. Leon Phelps is hilarious.
training	Leo Kessler	Leo Kessler	With so many cities lying in ruins, Leo Kessler a young American of German descent feels obliged to help in their restoration.
training	Leo Genn	Leo Genn	Typically of these British films, the cast showcases several established (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and up-and-coming (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) stars, to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell).
training	Leo Argyle	Leo Argyle	However, this takes a terrible turn when a man comes to their house and gives them evidence that █████████ couldn't commit his mother's murder.
training	Leo	Leo	The American, named Leo, doesn't fully get what he's doing there.
training	Leo	Leo	It draws you into the story and makes you jump into Leo's head, which at times is a scary place to be The movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side.
training	Leo	Leo	Her face is huge in the back and Leo's is in the foreground One of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with facial close ups.
training	Leo	Leo	Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?
training	Lenny Henry	Lenny Henry	The cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti.
training	Lena Olin	Lena Olin	Though I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I have read my share, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this film, and I wasn't disappointed. It does run out of steam near the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems like Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting room floor. Also, a little of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun. All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys; somehow, it seemed appropriate.
training	Lena	Lena	Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren't we all?
training	Lena	Lena	The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life.
training	Lena	Lena	The director should have just stuck with the romantic side of Lena and made a separate movie for the politics.
training	Lemmon	Lemmon	"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ending their career together. Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as ""raunchy"" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In the Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another. Not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough. Although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy."
training	Leif Trondstad	Leif Trondstad	British intelligence in London to take action Professor Leif Trondstad volunteered the services of eleven young Norwegians
training	Lee Majors	Lee Majors	"I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12"" x 10"". So I really wasn't going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the Middle, so I thought I'd watch just a few minutes. Next thing I know I'm sucked in, having a great time, and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by. I agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the older baby boomers, I was also pleased to see Lee Majors with a role in the movie, as with a couple of other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) ""yesterday"" but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselves. It's your basic ""kid is wronged, kid gets even (and then some), and everyone enjoys themselves in the process"". No heavy thinking, no great analysis needed. Just a good fun way to pass the time. 3.5 out of 5."
training	Lebowski	Lebowski	And The Big Lebowski was hysterical!
training	Leandro Lucchetti	Leandro Lucchetti	Un Gatto nel Cervello/Cat in the Brain is one of the goriest horror movies ever made.There is a lot of blood and gore,including chainsaw butchery,bloody stabbings and numerous decapitations.The film is also interesting as self parody of Fulci,but the gore and violence is the key element in it.Some of the gore FX were taken from own Fulci's movies Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio and I Fantasmi di Sodoma(both 1988),plus gore FX taken from Fulci-supervised The Snake House aka Bloody Psycho by Leandro Lucchetti,Massacre by Andrea Bianchi,Non Avere Paura Della Zia Marta by Mario Bianchi,Non Si Sevizia i Bambini by Giovanni Simonelli and Luna di Sangue aka Fuga dalla Morte by Enzo Milioni(all 1989).The scene where Brett Halsey beats the woman's face to pulp is from Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio,a film Fulci had made for Italian TV in 1988.The chainsawing of the female corpse at the beginning is taken from the same film,as is the head in the microwave and the guy that gets driven over and over again.Highly recommended,especially if you like extreme cinema!
training	Lea Thompson	Lea Thompson	This is one of those feel good, Saturday afternoon movies. It's right up there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up. And it's fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson.
training	Laxman	Laxman	The stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary (we get it, Laxman isn't the sharpest tool in the shed)

training	Laurie	Laurie	Instead Laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to Curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor.
training	Laurence Olivier	Laurence Olivier	This was by far the best war documentary ever made From the very beginning of the first episode when Sir Laurence Olivier described the horrific events in Oradour-Sur-Glane 'The day the soldiers came' To the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over Japan
training	Laurence Myers	Laurence Myers	For the record, the executive producer Laurence Myers was also responsible for the nerve-shreddingly awful
training	Lauerence Fishburne	Lauerence Fishburne	I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval , Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed. Now I just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
training	Lars von Trier	Lars von Trier	Lars von Trier woke film noir from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war German photographs I saw.

training	Lars	Lars	Before Dogma 95: when Lars used movies as art, not just a story.
training	Larry Miller	Larry Miller	NOT ONE about.. anything I feel sorry for Larry Miller, and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable venue.
training	Larry	Larry	This is an early one from the boys, but some people may not be satisfied with this one like all the others. I found it to be different somehow than the your average Stooge slapstick. It was more funny for it's jokes rather than the poke in the eye or slap. Watch for a hilarious part when Larry grabs the stethoscope from Moe and sings into it. Moe gives him a good smack. That part made me crack up for a good ten minutes. Another hit for the Stooges.
training	Larenz Tate	Larenz Tate	This movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad. More true to life characters looking for love, being in love, and loosing it. Old story fresh view. Larenz Tate was so Cary Grant in style as the character may have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out. Nia Long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man This movie is a classic, superb acting, well written, a real love story set in Chicago, what more can you ask for? SuperB Black Love Story
training	Langdon	Langdon	They take out Langdon's being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end.
training	Lang	Lang	Lang and Harbou are masterful at building suspense, especially at the banquet scene, which is intercut with Verbal's second performance to an amazing effect.
training	Lang	Lang	One can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to Lang's later, far superior work.
training	Lane	Lane	Gere and Lane have been in film together before
training	Landlord Edgar Kennedy	Landlord Edgar Kennedy	They also made other line-up changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall.THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach/MGM, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees.
training	Lancelo	Lancelo	Green is magic, silvermetallic is mankind's power, the forest is a place where Lancelo and Guenvere revel in their primitive essence.
training	Lance Smith	Lance Smith	The script by Lance Smith is so unfunny it's painful.
training	Lana Turner	Lana Turner	"And this unattractiveness is generally a reason I actually preferred the Italian film--since I just could NOT imagine a finely coiffed ""dish"" like Lana Turner in the middle of nowhere married to Kellaway--I am 100% sure she would have had dozens of better offers! Whereas, the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable. Part of the Italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex. The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway, they never actually get around to sex!"
training	Lamberto Bava	Lamberto Bava	This cheapo exploitation flick is some genuinely insipid stuff, courtesy of spaghetti land director Lamberto Bava, who wisely left his name off this junk.

training	Lady	Lady	I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, notwithstanding its base in a true story, its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him.
training	La Momia	La Momia	There's also another thing - watching La Momia can give you a clue what was the whole SF/Horror genre concept back in the fifties.
training	La	La	It is finally coming out. The first season will be available March 2007. It is currently airing on ABC Family from 4-5 pm eastern time Monday through Friday. The last episode will air on December 19th at 4:30. I missed it the first 100 times around. I wish I could buy the whole series right now. Who does she pick? I have to write 10 lines in order to reply to the first comment. What am I going to say. La da da de de. da da de de nope only up to 8 how do I get to 9 almost almost awww 9 now I need 10 - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, I missed counted this is only number 8. Punky Brewster is pretty awesome too.

training	Kurtz	Kurtz	His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity.
training	Kurt Russell	Kurt Russell	My favorite actor is Kurt Russell, so I think that he is a good actor in any role he plays.
training	Kurosawa	Kurosawa	Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius, his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers,
training	Kulbhushan Kharbanda	Kulbhushan Kharbanda	Set in modern day India, the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, faithful to his guru of sexless existence.
training	Kubrick	Kubrick	Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour mark, so it's quite telling that this Soderbergh, who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career, would think that His Oceanic Grandness was up to the task.
training	Kristine DeBell	Kristine DeBell	I thought Kristine DeBell was GREAT and was glad to see her move on into some more interesting roles
training	Kristine	Kristine	I guess since Kristine was of age, it was held against her and her promising career came grinding to a halt
training	Kristine	Kristine	But her starring role in Alice in Wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be, right on Kristine as the center of attention
training	Kristen Bell	Kristen Bell	I first saw this movie on the Lifetime Television network after hearing some good reviews and seeing previews. The plot follows Gracie(Kristen Bell), a 17 year old girl who deals with trying to keep her brothers from being taken away from her and put into foster homes due to her drug-addicted and often absent mother Rowena(Anne Heche). With stunning performances from both Bell and Heche as the daughter and mother duo the film has real edge. With the supporting cast including Diane Ladd, this television movie surpasses the stereotypes of a typical movie-of-the-week. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be inspired by a true story set to the screen.
training	Krishna Wamsi	Krishna Wamsi	The directorial style of writer/director Krishna Wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good.
training	Koresh	Koresh	You won't like Koresh any more after you see this than you did before, but I tend to think that you will come to believe, as I now do, there is much that we were not told about what happened before and during the standoff.
training	Konrack	Konrack	As to Stanley and Iris, I like education movies like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, that one with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc.

training	Kitty	Kitty	Someone calls the police, and suddenly they are there trying to save Kitty.
training	Kirsten	Kirsten	A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The dream child was the worst without a doubt, I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels. But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridicules and I wasn't happy with where it went. Alice just became more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her carrying this film on her own didn't work for me. Freddy is also loosing his scare, this was just getting a bit silly.
training	Kirk Douglass	Kirk Douglass	Remove yourself from the Kirk Douglass aspects of the casting
training	Kirk Douglas	Kirk Douglas	Clint Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.Teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense,Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood delivers as only he can.Also,John Malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin.As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest,I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said,referring to his own career,I keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger.This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and Peterson should team together more often.
training	Kinski	Kinski	First of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while Kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit.
training	Kinski	Kinski	Being a Spaghetti Western enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if you're not, never mind this movie, or watch it only for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest.

training	Kevin Rapp	Kevin Rapp	Reflex action is yet another feather in the hat of writer/producer/ director █████████ .
training	Kevin McParland	Kevin McParland	I remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it). I don't remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade, a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. It's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. But where do i find it? How can i download it?
training	Kevin Kline	Kevin Kline	"IN & OUT, in my opinion, is a very hilarious movie. I thought that Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong to say that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. The part I liked most was Howard's bachelor party. This was because they were cracking jokes about a lot of things, including Barbra Streisand films. I also thought that Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that Howard looked good in his tuxedo. My favorite quote of IN & OUT is, ""Is everybody gay? Is this 'THE TWILIGHT ZONE'?"" That was absolutely hilarious! The one character I couldn't stand was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). This was because she was VERY conceited and snobby. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all you Kevin Kline fans who have not seen it. Be prepared to laugh HARD and have a good time when you see it."
training	Kevin Finnerty	Kevin Finnerty	Only he's not speaking with his normal accent, and there seems to be something wrong with his papers: apparently, he is not Tony Soprano but Kevin Finnerty, or at least that's what a group of people think, and until the mess is sorted out he can't leave his hotel.
training	Kevin Costner	Kevin Costner	The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld.
training	Kevin Bacon	Kevin Bacon	Kevin Bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who, along with a team of collaborators, discover the way to make animals invisible.
training	Kevin Bacon	Kevin Bacon	However, on a brighter note, I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this movie, so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it.
training	Kevin	Kevin	Kevin gave convincing performances.
training	Kenny Rogers'	Kenny Rogers'	The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange face lift.
training	Kenny Johnson	Kenny Johnson	I remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it).

training	Kenny G	Kenny G	You could strap me to a chair, perform a root canal without freezing and blast Kenny G... instead of torturing me to watch this awful movie again.
training	Kenny Doughty	Kenny Doughty	I admit I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable, but reasonable plot.
training	Kenneth Driscoll	Kenneth Driscoll	The plot of this film in essence is movie star Kenneth Driscoll's discovery and romancing of a budding young starlet whom he discovers while shooting on location in the country.
training	Kenneth Driscoll	Kenneth Driscoll	She is immediately attracted to the dashing film star Kenneth Driscoll
training	Kenneth Branagh	Kenneth Branagh	Now here comes Kenneth Branagh's version, which is breathtaking from start to finish.
training	Kenneth	Kenneth	Kenneth plays the role of Hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears.
training	Kennedy	Kennedy	Kennedy performs his role very well and makes a hilarious character
training	Kennedy	Kennedy	I think they made Kennedy's character more stupid than he deserved to be. Then again, the whole movie I think was just a big tease about how a lot of kids nowadays
training	Ken Stott	Ken Stott	Gripping drama and Ken Stott was brilliant
training	Ken Burns	Ken Burns	Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary?
training	Kelsey	Kelsey	Then this film comes highly recommended. Kelsey Grammer gives an excellent performance here.
training	Kelly Preston	Kelly Preston	Kelly Preston was quite the young budding actress then too. She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie. I agree it's not an Oscar caliber movie. But very much worth watching. Especially if you have kids in the , let's say, 8 to 11 year old range. Or ones that are interested in the space program.
training	Kelly Preston	Kelly Preston	Successful self-made married businessman Harry Mitchell (a superbly steely performance by Roy Scheider) has an adulteress fling with sweet'n'sexy young stripper Cini (the gorgeous Kelly Preston).

training	Keenan Ivory Wayans	Keenan Ivory Wayans	"The script for ""Scary Movie 2"" just wasn't ready to go This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident, to the actors and the audience alike Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many of the actors are funny people;"
training	Keaton	Keaton	"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ending their career together. Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as ""raunchy"" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In the Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another. Not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough. Although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy."
training	Keanu	Keanu	I was intrigued to see this movie after I found out that it was one of Keanu's earlier film debuts.
training	Kayla	Kayla	I think Kayla should change her hairstyle, it was better before.
training	Kay Medford	Kay Medford	Kay Medford is very good as a Mother out of touch with reality.
training	Kay Lenz	Kay Lenz	What kept me watching it is Kay Lenz she's both endearing and feisty, and she looks particularly sexy when she's angry.
training	Kathy	Kathy	The problem wasn't Kathy, it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place.
training	Kathy	Kathy	But Kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think Fried Green Tomatoes.
training	Kathrine Hepburn	Kathrine Hepburn	This movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad. More true to life characters looking for love, being in love, and loosing it. Old story fresh view. Larenz Tate was so Cary Grant in style as the character may have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out. Nia Long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man This movie is a classic, superb acting, well written, a real love story set in Chicago, what more can you ask for? SuperB Black Love Story
training	Katherine Heigl	Katherine Heigl	Katherine Heigl can not act.
training	Katharine	Katharine	He meets a female fighter, Katharine, who appears to be homeless but who can fight and defeat men twice her size.
training	Kate Winslet's	Kate Winslet's	Kate Winslet's performance is also of great note.
training	Kate Jackson	Kate Jackson	What else can I say  Kate Jackson must have been desperate to direct
training	Kate Hudson	Kate Hudson	"Mathew McConaughey can act, but not in this. Kate Hudson can act , but not in this. This is not a ""chick flic"";no woman I know would knowingly sit through this forced, unfunny film much less force her boyfriend to do so. A genuine stinker!"
training	Kate Capshaw	Kate Capshaw	"Hurrah! A space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp. The film starts slowly, the usual mix of idiots and high-fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup. But when the going gets tough - the tough get themselves sorted out and it's not an un-believable change in the characters as you can believe that there's some responsibility in their young minds. The only flaw in the film is that Kate Capshaw is EXTREMELY annoying as the ""I'm right and you're all wrong"" instructor. I would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 Vote."
training	Kate	Kate	The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist').
training	Kate	Kate	My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!).
training	Kate	Kate	My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!)
training	Kate	Kate	My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can not wait for the next one.
training	Kate	Kate	I did get to like the character of Kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end.
training	Karloff	Karloff	"When I first heard that there was an Arabian movie featuring the Western icon ""Hopalong Cassidy""(William Boyd) and the Gothic icon Boris Karloff, the idea sounded like a disparate joke."
training	Karl Malden	Karl Malden	It's about an embezzler, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates a British company, Texa-Conn or something like that, posing as a computer whiz and security expert. He secretly learns to hack into the computer, while gathering the admiration of his boss, Karl Malden, the enmity of his office rival, Bob Newhart, and the love of his inept secretary, Maggie Smith
training	Karen Mills	Karen Mills	It begins with Jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney--daughter in law of John Huston, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter.
training	Kareena	Kareena	Well if you really listen closely, whatever they speak is actually unintelligible.Camera work is bad, editing is not present, background score gives a headache, action is shoddy, dialogs are unintelligible, Acting is abysmal and well Kareena used to look like a wrestler, now she looks like a starved wrestler.
training	Kamala Hassan	Kamala Hassan	I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.
training	Kaige	Kaige	Kaige succeeds in this beautifully done film. The pace matches the story, the direction is superb, and the casting/acting is perfect. The only draw back are one or two slight editing errors. I love film and I am a confessed stickler.
training	Kaientai	Kaientai	A couple funny spots, and Kaientai is always money.
training	KIng Boxer	KIng Boxer	Along come Run Run Shaw and co with their widescreen home movie production values, and astonishing ripe-for-parody dubbing and all the rules have changed KIng Boxer was the first in through the door, leaving a clearly marked trail for others to follow with their feet planted firmly on top of the blazed footsteps.
training	June Whitfield	June Whitfield	June Whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own right.
training	June Duprez	June Duprez	"I found myself singing ""I want to be a sailor"" for months after the film left town. I would recommend this movie to any and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet. Also, ██████████ was never lovelier than she was in this picture. The color was outstanding. Give this movie an AAA!"
training	Julie Walters	Julie Walters	Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters.
training	Julie Delpy	Julie Delpy	Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer).
training	Julie Delpy	Julie Delpy	"The primary reason to see ""Before Sunrise,"" is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines."
training	Julie Andrews	Julie Andrews	"I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did they get bedroom scenes, a seduction story line, two strip tease acts, and war/shooting/blood into a G rating? Weird. I would rate it PG-13. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was great. The storyline was a little weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue. There were too many ""no talking, just walking"" scenes for me... I would have liked to see the the relationship between Julie and Rock blossom, so that the intense love would be more believable."
training	Julie	Julie	The acting was very good although I thought that the actress playing Julie could have had more emotion behind her lines.
training	Julie	Julie	Following their daughter's brutal murder,Julie escape the city to find solace and grieve in a solitary cabin on a remote mountain.
training	Julian Sands	Julian Sands	I love Julian Sands and will at least attempt to watch anything he's in, but this movie nearly did me in I'm hard pressed to remember when I found any other movie to move....so......slow.........ly.....zzzzzzzzzzzz
training	Julian Noble	Julian Noble	Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a facilitator (hit-man) who specializes in high-end corporate gigs (assassinating rich dudes).
training	Julian Noble	Julian Noble	"Have read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble, ""Facilitator"" ... and is anything but pretty!"
training	Julia Stiles	Julia Stiles	"The music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over. The acting is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles' character ""Nicky"" put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light."
training	Julia Stiles	Julia Stiles	The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).
training	Julia Duffy	Julia Duffy	I think this movie is my favorite movie. I am not sure why, but it is. Julia Duffy has been my favorite actress for awhile, and when I saw this, I went crazy. It's sort of romantic, and I definitely recommend this movie.
training	Julia	Julia	Julia was excellent playing the psychotic 'man behind the man'.
training	Julia	Julia	Raul Julia was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police.
training	Julia	Julia	My Daughter Julia is 23rd in command of the Planet Earth and a bridge officer.
training	Julia	Julia	As having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive.
training	Jules Verne	Jules Verne	Jules Verne wrote about 80 novels as well as plays and short stories in his career
training	Judy	Judy	I recently watched the '54 version of this film with Judy, and while i appreciated the story and music, i found that the film failed to hold my attention.
training	Judson Mills	Judson Mills	I am a Judson Mills fan but also a huge Chuck Norris fan and while I'll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little, the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired. The opening fifteen minutes with Deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed.
training	Judi Dench	Judi Dench	The classical actors are cast in bit parts Judi Dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines, but at least they're in it.
training	Judd Nelson	Judd Nelson	I also thought that the cast in this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole
training	Joyce Grenfell	Joyce Grenfell	This film, without doubt, is the clearest example of the British humour the Germans can't understand. One-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in British cinema history (St.Trinians). The story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials enables Frank Launder to direct maximum talent from all the cast. It's probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match, in Alastair Sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve mentions in Dighton's masterpiece of English etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure. No Rutherford/Sim/Grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83mins long.
training	Joyce	Joyce	"amazing movie. Some of the script writing could have been better (some cliched language). Joyce's ""The Dead"" is alluded to throughout the movie. Beautiful scenery and great acting. Very poetic. Highly recommend."
training	Jovovich	Jovovich	There are some nice moments, most notably when Jovovich sings about Portugal.
training	Jouvet	Jouvet	Jouvet was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones.
training	Josie Lawrence	Josie Lawrence	Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes.

training	Joseph	Joseph	This masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master Joseph W. Sarno. It features plenty of soft core sex,really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women. The acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well-made. Marie Forsa is one of the hottest chicks I have ever seen in a horror movie-it's a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body. Sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies. A must see for fans of sexploitation!
training	Jose Ferrer	Jose Ferrer	An actor is always helped made better, challenged more by working with other great actors, and she is working here with one of the very best, ██████████ .

training	Johnny Winters	Johnny Winters	Let us not forget Johnny Winters as the CIA agent and the several guest stars playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett -- all perfectly done.. All in all, a memorable romp under the Paradorian moon.. -R.
training	Johnny Mercer	Johnny Mercer	The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to brag out
training	Johnny Knoxville	Johnny Knoxville	It's been a while since I've watched this movie, and the series, but now I'm refreshing my memory! This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the General Lee.
training	Johnny Kitagawa	Johnny Kitagawa	(He wasn't really not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).
training	Johnny	Johnny	The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City.
training	Johnny	Johnny	However, the last scene at Johnny's birthday party was cut way too short.
training	John Woo's	John Woo's	Although John Woo's hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite movie.
training	John Woo	John Woo	John Woo - greater director of the century.Maybe hi is not more intellectual than lot of Big Directors...
training	John Woo	John Woo	It's resolutely silly and juvenile, so if you want a good bit of serious Hong Kong action, look to a John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping movie.
training	John Woo	John Woo	"I say ""small"" because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions, as in a John Woo film."
training	John Williams	John Williams	John Williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item.
training	John Williams	John Williams	locale and lush John Williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item.
training	John Williams	John Williams	The production quality, cast, premise, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) locale and lush John Williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item. Unfortunately, all we got was a passable 2 star flick, mostly memorable for what it tried to do.........bring an art house style film mainstream. The small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself, and if well done, will satisfy most grownups.
training	John Williams	John Williams	The cast is good, while not excellent As another commenter pointed out the John Williams sound score was, as usual, excellent.
training	John Williams	John Williams	My surprise was great when I discovered the score to have been written by none other than John Williams himself.
training	John Wayne	John Wayne	This movie is absolutely stupid and wonderful at the same time. It's an Airplane-type movie. It does all the silly jokes, visual and verbal. The star, Gary Kroeger, slips into a fair John Wayne impersonation throughout the movie. Marc Singer as the German Von Kraut, is fantastic, and does a terrific accent. If you enjoy this type of movie, find it, watch it, and enjoy. It's great.
training	John Wayne	John Wayne	The highlight of the first ten minutes, John Wayne is serenading his prisoners,
training	John Wayne	John Wayne	I thank John Wayne for having the guts to release this picture with a message, as heavy handed as it is.
training	John Waters	John Waters	Trouble by John Waters and that was even worse. The dialogues, the acting, it really stank.
training	John Waters	John Waters	Phew--I don't what to say This is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers Some of the acting reminded me of John Waters█ early offerings Perhaps I should take that back--I don't want to insult Waters' ability as a director/storyteller.
training	John Waters	John Waters	A brilliant film by the great John Waters. The characters are unforgettable. The acting, script, and camera-work only enhance the overall greatness of this film. Perversion as an art-form. A must see for all. Easily a perfect 10!
training	John War Eagle	John War Eagle	In addition to those mentioned above, J.C. Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence..  A classic western in every sense of the word.
training	John Voigt	John Voigt	As to Stanley and Iris, I like education movies like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, that one with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc.

training	John Qualls	John Qualls	Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. This cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
training	John Mills	John Mills	 ***************************MILD SPOILERS AHEAD************************** We Dive at Dawn is an English made movie with John Mills in the lead role. The second time I watched the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I must say the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the samll screen. May be it was the big screen viewing that helped? I still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled, but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission, the movie takes off too! The search for the German battleship named the Brandenburg and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting! I'm increasing my rating to 7/10. If you enjoy WW II films, I think you'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway. Some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor, too!

training	John Leguizamo	John Leguizamo	This is by far the best stand-up routine I have ever seen. John Leguizamo's one man show tells the supposed story of his life in a barrage of lines and situations. By far better than any other comedy out there.

training	John Glover	John Glover	"This slick and gritty film consistently delivers. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights."
training	John Gilbert	John Gilbert	William Haines is his usual wonderful comedic self, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor.
training	John Garfield	John Garfield	I am referring to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane.Why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad-boy-rebel John Garfield.

Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence..  A classic western in every sense of the word.
training	John Denver	John Denver	I was reviewing some old VHS tapes I have and came across The TV show John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together.
training	John De Bello	John De Bello	Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. This cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
training	John Daniels	John Daniels	All the actors do themselves proud, especially John Daniels, must see another of his films.
training	John Cusack	John Cusack	War Inc. is a funny but strange film. The actors are likable, the film is likable also, but I don't know how to describe the plot. I will go into the plot later on. This is a movie with some weird casting choices. Besides John Cusack as a hit-man
training	John Cleese	John Cleese	Let's not forget John Cleese
training	John Cassavetes	John Cassavetes	██████████████ ' films have never been known for having a clear resolution or for their tidy, organised stories.
training	John Cassavetes	John Cassavetes	I would certainly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in Avant Garde film makers such as Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes, or Jim Jarmusch.
training	John Carrol Lynch	John Carrol Lynch	"I recently bought this movie and I do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact I am very please have this movie to add to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, movie directors, took less than one month to film and spent about 1 million EUR to produce this great movie. This proves that not only big productions make great movies. The title of this movie fits in perfectly. In computer language BUG means program error which causes reactions in computer function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. The vertiginous happenings in this movie start with the death of a BUG. A man witnesses the ""crime"" on the other side of the road...From there onwards everything gets complicated... I point out John Carrol Lynch (""Fargo""), Wallece, the man who cannot make everything right at all."

training	John	John	John Cusack stars as Hoops in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies.
training	John	John	This movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber.  This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial English town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl-to-die-for Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by email from Russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by Johns plan.
training	John	John	This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better. It almost were. With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger..., music almost like in, say, Conan... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart of John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before-mentioned Crouching Tiger... I am really ashamed of poor old.

training	Joe Pantoliano	Joe Pantoliano	The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: Anderson, Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts, with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee's merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri, Viveca Lindfors as Theirry's wise, perceptive mother Tatta, Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack, and Steve Buscemi as a funny, blithely shameless thief.

training	Joanna Pacula	Joanna Pacula	Joanna Pacula is OK.
training	Joan Cusack	Joan Cusack	It's skillfully written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can look at Bob Newhart in this movie and not chuckle, you're more of a man than I.For that matter, I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the How to be a Man cassette, and the post-(almost-)wedding scenes w/ Joan Cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie.Sure, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but...few movies are perfect.

Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Rolle. The show would have been dead if JJ would't have been there to save it with his always Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980's when I was just growing up.

Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).

And when it comes to looks, this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see. And then there's the personality of the movie as well, interesting, with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images. The movie probably won't affect your lifestyle, ruining these beauties, but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is. This movie deserves it's 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed."
training	Jeremy	Jeremy	Jeremy Northam's characterization of the stuttering, mild mannered bookish Morgan Sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of Lucy Liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch.

training	Jennifer Welles	Jennifer Welles	First saw this gem from Joe Sarno way back when, and I must say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a Sarno film, but when she made her entrance, the first time I ever saw her anywhere, I was sat up and took notice. Her presence in this film is hard to avoid, and spices up every scene she's involved in.
training	Jennifer Tung	Jennifer Tung	Good show, very entertaining. Good marshal arts acting. Good story plot. The entire main crew did a nice job from Robert Urich, to Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a BIG hand to Judson Mills. An especially fine tribute to Robert Urich, in his latter days. A GREAT ! actor who will be truly missed.
training	Jennifer Sky	Jennifer Sky	Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show. You shouldn't take all the show seriously, but if you wanna have fun, that's your TV show. Being made by the producers of Xena is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 isn't that different from Xena. The female warriors formula is brought to the future, where they don't have to fight warriors or gods, but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface, and the humans are forced to live underground. Along the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They all are different, but as a team, they work really well. The three main actresses appeared previously in Xena, like most of the regular/guest cast (there are some known faces from Hercules too, or from both shows). I specially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from any of her roles I previously knew.
training	Jennifer Rubin	Jennifer Rubin	This movie is one of the best and moving I have ever seen, because of the terrible good performance of the main actress Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who really makes you feel with her. Also the music by Mark Snow is wonderful.
training	Jennifer McAllister	Jennifer McAllister	I remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it). I don't remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade, a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. It's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. But where do i find it? How can i download it?
training	Jennifer Lopez'	Jennifer Lopez'	Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all. This is where the film gets all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st-Century CGI update of Dr Who's kaleidoscopic favourite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place, ruled over by D'Onofrio, now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body.
training	Jennifer Jones	Jennifer Jones	This movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers, especially contemporary audiences. Nevertheless I enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down-to-earth charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could've been trite lines. The cinematography of Hong Kong from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie. All in all, a better than average romantic drama, 7/10.

The movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal I loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie!!!!

training	Jennifer Aniston	Jennifer Aniston	"Rock Star is a ""nice"" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice. Chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. It's a good movie, despite all the niceness. Maybe I'm just used to all the angst of the X Gen music. In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believable. Mark Wahlberg's acting is quite good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well, but it was uncomplicated. She was a nice girl. Go see it. If you have ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, go see it."
training	Jennie Livingston	Jennie Livingston	In the beginning of this film, one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him: he is black and male But in addition to that, he has a third strike: he's gay You're going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined, he is told Paris is Burning is a documentary about gay black and Hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals. The miracle of Paris is Burning is that director Jennie Livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity We learn their views of homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams.
training	Jenna Jameson	Jenna Jameson	Oh yeah! Jenna Jameson did it again! Yeah Baby! This movie rocks It was one of the 1st movies i saw of her
training	Jenn Rivell	Jenn Rivell	While some of the things in Haggard are dumb and unnecessary, the overall package is good.  Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) trying to win back Glauren (Jenn Rivell), Ryan's ex.  The story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story. And, for all the Bam fan boys (And girls) there are multiple sequences of Bam skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even Don Vito got a bigger (but pointless) roll. If you are hoping to see a comedy and escape Bam's craziness, then stay away from this movie, otherwise, enjoy the time you spend with it, if you can find it. There are some truly funny scenes in this film.

training	Jean-Marc Barr	Jean-Marc Barr	The actions of the characters, especially of Leopold Kessler played by Jean-Marc Barr seem confused, and lack credibility.
training	Jean-Jacques	Jean-Jacques	Jean-Jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. This intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. In that sense it repeats a theme common to French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery may well hold true in France; at any rate, it's quite romantic.

training	Jason Connery	Jason Connery	Excellent performance. There still are good actors around! Also great directing and photography. Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.
training	Jason Connery	Jason Connery	Although this was obviously a low-budget production, the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing. One of Walken's few musical roles to date. (he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well - watch for the cartwheel!) Also starring Jason Connery. A great children's story and very likable characters

training	Janine Turner	Janine Turner	"But the movie has numerous assets : breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed, stunning special and visual effects ( the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film ), excellent musical score, welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension, and a solid cast : two heroes ( Stallone, star and cowriter, has the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent Michael Rooker more than stands his ground ), a charming heroin (Janine Turner), and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever ( priceless John Lithgow and deceivingly feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass ) Good, solid entertainment then , if no credibility.As Roger Ebert wrote ( about another film )""It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much."""
training	Janeway	Janeway	The journey was 23 years, but captain Janeway has the power to reduce it...
training	Janeane Garofalo	Janeane Garofalo	Though I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I have read my share, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this film, and I wasn't disappointed. It does run out of steam near the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems like Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting room floor. Also, a little of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun. All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys; somehow, it seemed appropriate.
training	Janeane Garofalo	Janeane Garofalo	"This was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughs. Considering the storyline and the lead actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be. Only part of this made me really laugh, such as when Murray lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) The supporting cast was anything but likable people. Just look at a sampling of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role in here as ""Tip Tucker"" was just downright annoying. He was the worst. Other that those people, the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop."

A classic western in every sense of the word.
training	James Marsden	James Marsden	Even while trying to recover an extremely poor script with above average actors, this movie is a bomb. What started out as enticing, quickly became boring and relatively unbelievable. James Marsden (X-Men, Sugar and Spice) is a high school student who is forced to transfer to a new school in a small town after living the big city life in Chicago. Shortly after arrival, he learns of a community plot to surgically brain wash all the teens into perfection. After deciding to be the hero, he is overshadowed by a moronic janitor played by William Sadler (Project X, Demon Knight, Shawshank Redemption) who saves the day with an El Camino filled with high pitch whistling rat traps. With numerous plot holes and unexplained story lines, this movie is not much above a quick cure for insomnia.

training	James	James	i didn't enjoy this movie at all.for one,i just found it crude and vulgar,for no reason.i also felt it's misogynistic(against women.)also,the movie really doesn't appear to be about anything,and i didn't find any of the characters likable.really,the there doesn't seem to be any point to it all.maybe i'm missing something,but for me,this movie is pretty much a waste of time,when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable.like using my face as a pin cushion.James garner is in this thing,as are C.Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones,and Cromwell.all are wasted here,and i'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers.Jennilee Harrison(from the later years of Three's Company)is also in the movie,and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role.but other than that,she can't rise above the mediocre script.for me,Tank is a 3/10
training	James	James	I LOVED GOOD TIMES with the rest of many of you. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL commentary. The writers on THIS show were fantastic and the Actors were beyond TALENTED. To answer Strawberry22 (the neatest commentary to the other superior and positive commentary)...What happened was that James was killed in an accident (I believe I remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it first aired and I was a tiny thing...it was so sad to me..).

training	Jackson	Jackson	"I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie that I'd seen, ""Burning Moon"". But while that movie was rather grim and nasty, ""Premutos"" seems to mostly play it for laughs. While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worthwhile to see this), I found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene. Sure, there's gore, and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition. Many are comparing this to Peter Jackson's movies, especially ""Braindead"". But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in ""Bad Taste"", it's clear Ittenbach is lacking one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and plentiful gore effects, and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)"
training	Jackie Mason	Jackie Mason	"Jackie Mason shows the saying that ""less is more""."
training	Jackie Chan	Jackie Chan	This is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here. This is still the best Action movie ever done. The action movies of today are badly done The actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly. only some no how to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan
training	Jackie Chan	Jackie Chan	This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better. It almost were. With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger..., music almost like in, say, Conan... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart of John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before-mentioned Crouching Tiger... I am really ashamed of poor old John. He is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better. So as you - so if you still have a chance just watch something else.
training	Jackie Chan	Jackie Chan	"Nothing I dislike more than a kung-fu movie that plays for laughs. It is the main reason I can't stand Jackie Chan (or his lookalikes). He was not always a clown, I must add. ""My Young Auntie"" is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind. It is a perfect example of how the subgenre was brought down to the mud by endless silly antics and childish behavior. Unless you are 5-year-old, I really don't understand how anyone could find this kind of film funny. But humor is indeed a very subjective thing. Personally, I think this type of approach did permanent damage to the beloved subgenre. I did think leading lady Kara Hui was very good here. But I had such a hard time sitting through this one that I could not enjoy her fine performance. If you don't mind all the silliness, you might enjoy it. I know I didn't."
training	Jackie Chan	Jackie Chan	I say this because the stunts, the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with Chrismas lights and slid down the pole fell through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor.

"" It is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. The storyline is simple but well-told. The only sub-par performance was by one of the kids. It was interesting to see how the kids had grown since that first movie. Of the three, that initial ""Sarah,"" was the best- filmed with some beautiful cinematography. This movie didn't have that, but it had the best story. It had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending. Highly recommended."

Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as ""raunchy"" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In the Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another. Not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough. Although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy."

Even ""spoofs"" lack the originality and natural feel of this film. It is a comedic classic that will surely be appreciated in another time when studios are fdoing this sort of thing regularly. kudos to the makers, and to a hilariously subtle cast of actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances is top-notch.

training	Holly	Holly	Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world (some 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation--a tall order that the team at Priority Films does with great success.
training	Holly	Holly	"For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is ""Wow"". It is such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic."
training	Holly	Holly	"""Holly"" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which wouldn't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience."
training	Hitler	Hitler	In the second plot, various highranking officers are conspiring to overthrow Hitler and bring the war to an end.
training	Hitler	Hitler	But this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of Hitler's world.
training	Hitler	Hitler	But only a few hundred of mostly Hitler Youth received some training, and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced-labourer foreigners in Bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants, with Hitler's death and the war's end it all fell apart However, the Werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers.
training	Hitcher	Hitcher	Even the worst Hitcher ripoffs are still better than this.
training	Hitchcock	Hitchcock	Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like Hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene.
training	Hitchcock	Hitchcock	One can see how Brian DePalma takes some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and stuff.
training	Hitchcock	Hitchcock	"In this I share Hitchcock's view, which says, 'A murder mystery is a slice of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny yourself this, you might as well film a documentary.'"""
training	Hitchcock	Hitchcock	I have read that Hitchcock wanted a different ending, but that it was shot down my the movie executives.
training	Hitchcock	Hitchcock	I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, notwithstanding its base in a true story, its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him.
training	Hiroshi Tôyama	Hiroshi Tôyama	A sound effects engineer, Hiroshi Tôyama(Seiichi Tanabe), seems to be the only one who accepts her without contention, actually encouraging once she receives the leading role after the actress dies under suspicious, and very unusual, circumstances.
training	Hillary Clinton	Hillary Clinton	These folks make Hillary Clinton seem like a rightwing extremist in comparison.
training	Hilda	Hilda	"I remember first watching Sabrina when it came to TV in the UK on ITV1 when i was 13/14. I'm now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it. I get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a ""kids show"" but i don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as ""Hilda"" is my personal favourite character and Later on Morgan also became another of my favourite characters. I remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring Sabrina on the TV station Nickeleoden UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great in ""Clarrissa Explains All"" but so much better in this. I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK - I'll be first in line! lol x"
training	Hilary Swank	Hilary Swank	This movie is specially for children and I think they will enjoy the movie. For older than 10 the movie is not great but Hilary Swank played very well and without her the movie is very bad but now it gets a 7.
training	Highlander	Highlander	I never thought much of Highlander (same director) but that one could be blamed on the 80s.
training	Heyerdahl	Heyerdahl	Thor Heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient Incas in Peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia
training	Heyerdahl	Heyerdahl	In order to test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as closely as possible to what the ancient Incas had available
training	Heston	Heston	"Heston casually getting into bed with the ""furniture"""" while discussing something else completely unrelated!"
training	Hercule Poirot	Hercule Poirot	Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late '60s satire. Ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler (we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor's tax return) who, sensing that the future is in computers, poses (by means of a deft piece of identity theft) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an American multinational
training	Herbert Marshall	Herbert Marshall	but thought Herbert Marshall was a class addition and sat myself down for a good cheesy flick. Boy, was I wrong. Dullsville.
training	Herbert Hoover	Herbert Hoover	Madison is a carefree happy-go-lucky if rather irresponsible slob who's refrigerator was last cleaned probably when Herbert Hoover was still in the White House.
training	Henry Silva	Henry Silva	"Belmondo is a tough cop He goes after a big-time drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, normally a great villain - see ""Sharky's Machine""; but here he is clearly dubbed, and because of that he lacks his usual charisma)"
training	Henry Ford	Henry Ford	An illiterate, nice guy loser who turns out to actually be, with a little help from Jane's character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison.
training	Henry Brown	Henry Brown	Riding into Dodge City with his trusty friend, Johnny Williams {Millard Mitchell}, Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown {Stephen McNally}, the man he wants.
training	Henry Brommel	Henry Brommel	"Writer/director Henry Brommel has done a wonderful job with his film, ""Panic,"" from the year 2000, and that includes his choice of cast: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain, David Dorfman."
training	Hellman	Hellman	Lillian Hellman, one of America's most famous women playwrights, was a woman with a mission.
training	Helena	Helena	i thought this movie was really really great! Helena did an amazing job in it! I thought she played her character very well! she's an AWESOME actress!!
training	Helen Baxendale	Helen Baxendale	Excellent performance. There still are good actors around! Also great directing and photography. Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.
training	Helen	Helen	At first it's seen as the most suspenseful thing in the film so far as Helen leads her class along a mountainside and stops to have lunch.
training	Heifetz	Heifetz	The role of a classical musician like Heifetz is to move the audience, not him or herself.
training	Heero Yuy	Heero Yuy	"Purists can stick to Japanese all they want, but for a more ""realistic"" experience i recommend the English track since all the characters, except Heero Yuy, are not Japanese."
training	Hector Perez	Hector Perez	In 1963, Hector Perez was already a promising young singer in his native Puerto Rico when, at the age of seventeen, he moved to New York City to try and make a name for himself as a performer there.
training	Hector Cordoba	Hector Cordoba	General Hector Cordoba is setting up as near-emperor in Northern Mexico, and steals a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing.
training	Heche	Heche	I first saw this movie on the Lifetime Television network after hearing some good reviews and seeing previews. The plot follows Gracie(Kristen Bell), a 17 year old girl who deals with trying to keep her brothers from being taken away from her and put into foster homes due to her drug-addicted and often absent mother Rowena(Anne Heche). With stunning performances from both Bell and Heche as the daughter and mother duo the film has real edge. With the supporting cast including Diane Ladd, this television movie surpasses the stereotypes of a typical movie-of-the-week. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be inspired by a true story set to the screen.
training	Heath Leger	Heath Leger	I thought that this film was very well made, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless.
training	Heath Ledger	Heath Ledger	Set in Sydney's notorious King's Cross district (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex stores thrive), it tells the story of Jimmy (played by Heath Ledger).
training	Heath Ledger	Heath Ledger	I've never been much of Heath Ledger fan, having only seen him in teen type movies, however he is quite compelling in this role.
training	Hayao Miyazaki	Hayao Miyazaki	It is in my mind the masterwork of Hayao Miyazaki, the most talented of Japan's animated directors, and it best captures his strengths as a director, storyteller, and designer, as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes.
training	Hathaway	Hathaway	Henry Hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for his love of the people of the early days in US history.
training	Hastings	Hastings	I bought this while I was playing chess in Hastings
training	Harvey Korman	Harvey Korman	Munchies starts in deepest darkest Peru (looks more like a dirt road to me) where archaeologist Simon Watterman (Harvey Korman & his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are on an expedition.
training	Harvey Korman	Harvey Korman	Meanwhile Simon's brother & fast-food businessman Cecil Watterman (Harvey Korman again) steals the creature so his brother won't make any money out of it
training	Hartley	Hartley	What the hell happened to you, Hartley?
training	Hartley	Hartley	A movie that looks like it was filmed on someone's cell phone wouldn't have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog, but alas, those are missing, along with Hartley's spare, quirky dialog.
training	Harry Beaumont	Harry Beaumont	Dance -- one of *four* films that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long, yet its characters are well developed, its story never seems rushed, and despite its many twists in plot.

training	Harry	Harry	The gags spaced out in a way that gives maximum effect too, and Harry gets his own version of a Lloyd or Keaton style stunt at the end.
training	Harrison Ford	Harrison Ford	This is the man that made Harrison Ford run hard and run fast.
training	Harrison Ford	Harrison Ford	And yet, both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their respective characters as heros who manage to be both virile and gentle.
training	Harrison	Harrison	i didn't enjoy this movie at all.for one,i just found it crude and vulgar,for no reason.i also felt it's misogynistic(against women.)also,the movie really doesn't appear to be about anything,and i didn't find any of the characters likable.really,the there doesn't seem to be any point to it all.maybe i'm missing something,but for me,this movie is pretty much a waste of time,when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable.like using my face as a pin cushion.James garner is in this thing,as are C.Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones,and James Cromwell.all are wasted here,and i'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers.Jennilee Harrison(from the later years of Three's Company)is also in the movie,and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role.but other than that,she can't rise above the mediocre script.for me,Tank is a 3/10
training	Harold Lloyd's	Harold Lloyd's	Harold Lloyd's SPEEDY for the 'comedy direction' Oscar
training	Harold Lloyd	Harold Lloyd	Oddly, however, the film managed to beat out Harold Lloyd  film, SPEEDY, for an Oscar for Best Direction for a Comedy (a category no longer used)--as SPEEDY was a superior film in most ways (it  one of Lloyd  best films).

training	Hardy	Hardy	And somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever. The friendship they form reminded me a lot of Laurel and Hardy.
training	Hannibal Rising	Hannibal Rising	"In that regard this movie suffers from the same problem as ""Hannibal Rising""."
training	Hank Landry	Hank Landry	Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack O'Neill and General Hammond.
training	Hal Havins	Hal Havins	Bloodthirsty highlights include disgusting fat slob Hal Havins (who played a similarly irritating obese a**hole role in the immortal Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama around the same time) having his tongue bitten off, Quigley shoving a whole tube of lipstick in one of her breasts (yow!)
training	Haines	Haines	And amazingly touching after Haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets.
training	H.G. Wells	H.G. Wells	This movie is based on the novel Island of dr. Moreau By H.G. Wells. It's a fairly good one too, it's at least better than the version by John Frankenheimer.
training	H. Graham	H. Graham	Though, maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable. I especially mean the role of H. Graham.
training	Gwyneth Paltrow	Gwyneth Paltrow	I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr Knightley - where does one meet such a man???
training	Gwen Paltrow	Gwen Paltrow	I have read the book, and for those overly-critical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation, I don't know what else McGrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of Miss Austen's work, especially given the limitations of a two hour movie (which some have complained about being too long!). And as far as Gwen Paltrow accent is concerned, I must confess I wasn't too familiar with her when I saw this at the theater initially, and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress!
training	Guy Kibbee	Guy Kibbee	Besides those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is at his flustered best here.7 out of 10
training	Gustav	Gustav	The intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of glances between Gustav von Aschenbach a composer of some renown and a slim teenage youth Tadzio who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel dining room, on the beach and at odd unexpected places around Venice.
training	Gunga Din	Gunga Din	Gawd that made you, You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din█  I still, at 54 years of age, get misty eyed and anyone who says they don't is a liar.

training	Guantanamo	Guantanamo	Abu Ghraib, along with Guantanamo, will always be a scar on the conscience of America
training	Gruner	Gruner	"And I am now suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome. This movie was horrible. It was boring, unrealistic, and the acting was dreadful. The best part of the movie was the end credits because that signaled the end of my torture. Watching Gruner play the nice guy with moves of death and a heart of gold is wearing out its welcome. If I hear him say,"" I don't want to fight"" one more time I will scream in frustration. He has potential, but he is picking the wrong scripts. There were so many things in this movie I could nitpick, I would be typing for days. The worst would be Gruner blatantly plugging his own line of athletic gear. Then there is the gratuitous nudity, the requisite nosy reporter, and the bad guy wearing black. Skip this or suffer like I did."
training	Grisham	Grisham	I think I've seen all of the Grisham movies now and generally they're all very poor, except for The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad it's unbelievable WARNING SPOILERISH
training	Griffiths	Griffiths	Although, only 15 minutes long, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time.

training	Greenaway	Greenaway	But not good, Greenaway or Lynch-style pretentious or hilariously messy in an Ittenbach or early Waters sort of fashion.
training	Graves	Graves	They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves
training	Graham Norton	Graham Norton	Ireland may have given the world hurling, green beer, Graham Norton, and that funny dancing where the arms don't move, but it isn't exactly renowned for its horror movies.

training	Goldie Hawn	Goldie Hawn	Actually, Goldie Hawn███  is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I digress.
training	Goldie Hawn	Goldie Hawn	Actually, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I digress. This is sort of a Mr. Smith goes to Washington type of movie, with some variations but the same premise. I taped this movie off of cable years ago because I had a huge crush on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot's life. It made me laugh and made me mad at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous, I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD). It made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up. And the speech she made at the end...beautiful. Too bad not many people have guts like that in real life.
training	Goldie Hawn	Goldie Hawn	Actually, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I digress.
training	Goldie	Goldie	Goldie knew this was fun-fluff and she went ahead and did it
training	Goldie	Goldie	A pretty average movie but a brave one from Ms Hawn to promote this vehicle as Exec Producer & as a starring vehicle. Although she ends up vindicated, she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo. How many other A listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury pratfalls since this movie? Not many. Does this mean the female butt cannot be funny? Goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona & ventures in projects other won't.
training	Glenn Ford	Glenn Ford	It's a pity that goody-goody Glenn Ford gets in their way.
training	Glenn Close	Glenn Close	"I enjoyed two of the three movies in the ""Sarah, Plain & Tall"" trilogy. This, the final of the three, was definitely one of the ""good ones. "" It is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. The storyline is simple but well-told. The only sub-par performance was by one of the kids. It was interesting to see how the kids had grown since that first movie. Of the three, that initial ""Sarah,"" was the best- filmed with some beautiful cinematography. This movie didn't have that, but it had the best story. It had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending. Highly recommended."

training	Gina Torres	Gina Torres	Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show. You shouldn't take all the show seriously, but if you wanna have fun, that's your TV show. Being made by the producers of Xena is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 isn't that different from Xena. The female warriors formula is brought to the future, where they don't have to fight warriors or gods, but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface, and the humans are forced to live underground. Along the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They all are different, but as a team, they work really well. The three main actresses appeared previously in Xena, like most of the regular/guest cast (there are some known faces from Hercules too, or from both shows). I specially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from any of her roles I previously knew.
training	Gina Gershon	Gina Gershon	Here's a little nugget made for cable that revolves around a psychiatrist played by Gina Gershon.
training	Gigli	Gigli	In summary, this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times I have not seen Gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one, because of it's poor quality in every respect, must easily be worse then anything that mainstream.
training	Gigi	Gigi	"you can find happiness with ""fire and passion"" as the main character Gigi would say."
training	Getrumte Snden'	Getrumte Snden'	'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Getrumte Snden', is a struggle to sit through, even at a lean 76 minutes any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma.br
training	George W Bush	George W Bush	This end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about WWII, leading them to the conclusion that George W Bush is the latest heir to the Nazi throne.
training	George Sanders	George Sanders	George Sanders is so charming and, yes, low-key that all that talent, smarts, physical presence and above all, masculinity, seem, well, almost normal
training	George Sanders	George Sanders	George Sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated British do-gooder and he succeeds once again in making an excellent B-detective series film
training	George Kennedy	George Kennedy	George Kennedy is a well groomed, neatly presented bad guy who snarls with the best of them.
training	George Innes	George Innes	Everything I remember about it was excellent... great cast with Sam Waterston & George Innes (before he became more familiar to US audiences).... excellent scripts as only the English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes/Lord Peter Wimsey/Albert Campion type mysteries, but with a Jules Verne twist.
training	George Goble	George Goble	I could not find George Goble listed in the credits but I remember him in the movie. The sining was terrible and the songs even worse.
training	George Clooney	George Clooney	George Clooney can not begin to master the scene as Mr. Sanders does (and does without Mr. Clooney's mugging)
training	George Clooney	George Clooney	This has got to be the best movie I've seen. You definately have to watch it more than once to find all of the humor and twists. I'm no fan of George Clooney, but he shines here. The real performance comes from Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro as Pete and Delmar. One of the few movies that I own.
training	George Clooney	George Clooney	Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make George Clooney proud?

training	George Burns	George Burns	THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of Neil Simon's play about a retired vaudevillian team, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that. The problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other.

training	Gena Rowland	Gena Rowland	Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style Gena Rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness...and alcoholism She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts, embodied by the death spectre of a young girl Acceptance of oneself, of human condition, though its overall difficulties, is the real purpose of the film The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling: it's like if the stage became a way out for the Heroin If all american movies could only be that top-quality, dealing with human relations on an adult level, not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings.. One of the best dramas ever 10/10.

training	Gary Lewis	Gary Lewis	The performances are excellent, particularly that of Gary Lewis who gets better with every role My only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments.
training	Gary Kroeger	Gary Kroeger	This movie is absolutely stupid and wonderful at the same time. It's an Airplane-type movie. It does all the silly jokes, visual and verbal. The star, Gary Kroeger, slips into a fair John Wayne impersonation throughout the movie. Marc Singer as the German Von Kraut, is fantastic, and does a terrific accent. If you enjoy this type of movie, find it, watch it, and enjoy. It's great.

training	Garbo	Garbo	I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, notwithstanding its base in a true story, its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him.

training	Gail O'Grady	Gail O'Grady	This movie is an embarrassment to film-making I can't believe it was even listed as a comedy - not funny Not only was the script atrocious, but the casting people should be shot Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but beyond that.. %99 of the rest of the cast...ouch Pretty much everyone else...wow it is hard to even...wow Here is the number one rule about comedy DON'T TRY TO BE FUNNY There are a lot of very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them were used in this film Canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film-making in Canada I realize this is technically a US film, but look at the director, actors, location, etc I just saw this on Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film Again, there are a lot of great films out there that can't get airtime and they show this crap.

training	Freeman	Freeman	Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10
training	Frederic March	Frederic March	The movie begins well enough, as Frederic March (a fine actor) is in the lead.
training	Frederic Forrest	Frederic Forrest	Frederic Forrest in particular does a great job giving the audience the sense of a regular guy who thinks that something exotic is what he really needs.
training	Frederic Forrest	Frederic Forrest	Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
training	Freddy Kruger	Freddy Kruger	We are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly, even charismatic killer.
training	Freddy	Freddy	Come on. The new twist is nearly ok, but from avenging the Elm Street children Freddy is just killing people now. More of the same: Special effects with no actual character development or anything. Simply bad and insulting. SCARY..? Nope. Not at all. Just bad.
training	Freddy	Freddy	"Bottom-of-the-Freddy barrel. This is the worst film in the series, beating ""Freddy's Revenge"" for that title. A cheap-looking (with mediocre special effects), incoherent mess, with Freddy turned into a punster. He has one or two cool lines, but that doesn't save this illogical and sloppy sequel."
training	Freddy	Freddy	After the success of Part 4, another sequel was a natural move. However they should have stopped it before it began. Alice, having survived Part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems Freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims, which of course are Alice's friends. Strange Nightmare movie, very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the movie itself is not.
training	Fred MacMurray	Fred MacMurray	Saw it as many times as I could before it left the scene. A delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars. Only wish I could find it again! Would certainly buy/view it if I could. Please, somebody, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II, and his leading ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver were beautiful and charming
training	Fred Gwynne	Fred Gwynne	This movie has one of the cheesiest plots I have seen. For me, that's what makes it so awesome! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. While there was less slapstick, they still worked wonderfully together
training	Frankie Muniz	Frankie Muniz	I normally can't stand Frankie Muniz but he is just fine here.
training	Frankie	Frankie	Frankie tries to getaway from the life that he lead but has this monkey or, better yet, gorilla on his back that just won't let him.
training	Frank Sinatra's'	Frank Sinatra's'	"Highly recommended for it's feel-good factor alone. OK, so ███████████████ ""acting"" leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film."
training	Frank Sinatra	Frank Sinatra	Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs.
training	Frank Sinatra	Frank Sinatra	Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs.
training	Frank Sinatra	Frank Sinatra	Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the New York's longest- established floating craps game, and he needs $1000 to secure a new location.
training	Frank Oz	Frank Oz	The first feature length Muppet Movie, and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol, the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos, keeps to a simple but original plot, classic Muppet lame jokes, Paul Williams genius in song writing, and Electric Mayhem madness, and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with puppets. Half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor/actress still alive???? I can only hope Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive Kermit and Company from the deadly grasp of Disney.
training	Frank Launder	Frank Launder	This film, without doubt, is the clearest example of the British humour the Germans can't understand. One-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in British cinema history (St.Trinians). The story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials enables Frank Launder to direct maximum talent from all the cast. It's probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match, in Alastair Sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve mentions in Dighton's masterpiece of English etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure. No Rutherford/Sim/Grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83mins long.
training	Frank	Frank	The film moves quickly and it shows Frank's drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture.
training	Frank	Frank	I was hoping that this was a slow burner but in the end the only thing that could inject any life - and justice - into this is Frank pulling out his 9 and offing the whole cast starting with Tea and ending with himself - sorry it was that bad.
training	Frances Lee McCain	Frances Lee McCain	I saw this movie in 1976, my first year of living in New York. I went on to live there for the next 26 years,but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small TV movie. It was part of a PBS series as I recall, and I've never forgotten it.  There are no sex scenes to speak of, just delicate, moving, extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement, all set within a conservative, Boston (I think), World War 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war, and did not seek out a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is superb in the role of career photographer and I have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail. There has to be a video of this movie? Sure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video?
training	Foxx	Foxx	It will keep you wondering whats going to happen to Foxx next.
training	Forest Whitaker	Forest Whitaker	Forest Whitaker does his best mumbly, stumbly, heavy faced bit
training	Forbin	Forbin	Dr. Forbin , after activating his new computer, attends party at the White House and publicly states his wish that not only will his machine prevent war, but that it will also herald a new age of human advancement, in which famine and disease and pollution and overpopulation will be eliminated with the help of Colossus' vast computer power.
training	Fonda's	Fonda's	I have not always been a fan of Fonda's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time.
training	Fonda	Fonda	This film will be enjoyed by Fonda and De Niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level.
training	Fonda	Fonda	Even so, it's a good movie just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!
training	Foley	Foley	If you're a Foley fan, check this out.
training	Flynn	Flynn	You will be surprised at Flynn's comedy timing.
training	Flynn	Flynn	"Walsh and Flynn teamed in quite often afterward, and ""They Died with Their Boots On"" reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time."
training	Fisher	Fisher	The hypnotist laughs and says, Now, Fisher, she didn't really say that, did she?
training	Fisher	Fisher	And whenever Fisher, the narrator, gets off track, the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story.
training	Fishburne	Fishburne	Second, Fishburne is the first black actor to play Othello in a film.
training	Fifi	Fifi	Let's get to the guys who went after Goucem's neighbor Fifi, what is their real motivation
training	Fidani	Fidani	Infamous Director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, trashiest, and, well, worst contributions to the genre.
training	Fess Parker	Fess Parker	Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can anyone really play Davy but Fess Parker?
training	Fernack	Fernack	The Saint assists Inspector Fernack clear his name from a frame
training	Fenway Park	Fenway Park	A very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park.
training	Femme Nikita	Femme Nikita	"Femme Nikita"" ends up more like a try hard, B-grade action thriller."
training	Fellini	Fellini	In 50 years, when von Trier retires, he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet), and there will be classes taught in his name. He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time.
training	Faye Grant	Faye Grant	Faye Grant so Good in V is wasted with this script from hell. No suprises and no fun.
training	Fartman Maurice	Fartman Maurice	. This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious 'Fartman Maurice█ character As his lover says to him: 'Most people are embarrassed about farting You turn it into an art form.'
training	Farrell	Farrell	Blondell & Farrell are excellent. Blondell was edible. This was very funny and I laughed often throughout it. Great dialogue and its loaded with wisecracks. I could've watched it for hours. Tremendous fun to watch.
training	Family Guy	Family Guy	Father of the Pride was the best new show to hit television since Family Guy.
training	Fair	Fair	Fair drama/love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love.
training	Eytan Fox	Eytan Fox	Here's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian)in modern Tel Aviv
training	Eyes	Eyes	"A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck.""Mirage"" is obviously inspired by Spielberg's ""Duel"" and Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes"".Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.The film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.There is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.The acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak,but the film is fast-paced and shocking.B.G.Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.Overall,if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10."
training	Evelyn  Sister	Evelyn  Sister	██████ would be the obvious culprit.
training	Evelyn	Evelyn	Is it Evelyn back from death for revenge?
training	Evelyn	Evelyn	*SOILER* It's fake! The whole thing is a fake! There is no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself. So he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala SCOOBY-DOO to drive Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them. He's not even killing them. He drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace. If he looked at the so-called ghost of Evelyn, he could tell she was wearing gloves! My God what a waste of time. Don't bother watching it, renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE. I give this stinker the CRAP-O-LANTERN.
training	Evan Richard	Evan Richard	Faults do pop up in the story, as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour (or better putter comic relief) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richard's characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful.
training	Eva Gabor	Eva Gabor	Price portrays Don Gallico, a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by the lovely Eva Gabor).
training	Europa	Europa	It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this About Europa itself, I'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong.
training	Ethan Hawke	Ethan Hawke	Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on a European train. The two come from widely different backgrounds, he's American and she's French, after they talk a bit on the train Jesse manages to get Celine to get off the train and explore Vienna with him.
training	Esther Rolle	Esther Rolle	Back in 74 Eric Monte made the classic T.V show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching the Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Rolle. John Amos most of the time felt a little jealous of Jimmie Walker's popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch Good Times. The show would have been dead if JJ would't have been there to save it with his always Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980's when I was just growing up.
training	Esther Kahn	Esther Kahn	A masterpiece.  Thus it is, possibly, not for everyone.  The camera work, acting, directing and everything else is unique, original, superb in every way - and very different from the trash we are sadly used to getting.  Summer Phoenix creates a deep, believable and intriguing Esther Kahn.
training	Esther Forbes	Esther Forbes	However, he is convinced by a speculator, who wishes to buy the lands, and by his sexy wife Esther Forbes Hope North, who wants to move from that place, to analyze the meteor by himself.
training	Esperanza	Esperanza	Here ███ visits her parent for the birthday of her father, a which occasionally always have some kind of tragedy
training	Errol Morris	Errol Morris	I have been a huge Errol Morris fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a life.
training	Errol Morris	Errol Morris	As is obvious in the complex responses to both the book and the film by Errol Morris and Philip Gourevitch
training	Errol Flynn	Errol Flynn	Errol Flynn, as a sheepherder
training	Errol Flynn	Errol Flynn	None of the romanticizing Errol Flynn or Jack Sparrow stuff
training	Errol Flynn	Errol Flynn	By 1945, and after a string of solid WWII propaganda pieces, Errol Flynn’s hold over U.S. box office had started to decline so, in spite of the increased burden of waning looks, he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name: the swashbuckler.
training	Ernest	Ernest	This is a good film. This is very funny. Yet after this film there were no good Ernest films!
training	Erika Eleniak	Erika Eleniak	Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak don't really provide much either.
training	Erika Christensen	Erika Christensen	What a surprise; two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film. This is the best work Busy Phillips has ever done and the best from Erika Christensen since Traffic. This film certainly should be in Oscar contention. See this movie!
training	Erika Christensen	Erika Christensen	Taking place after a high school shooting, two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form an unlikely bond.
training	Erika	Erika	the best from Erika Christensen since Traffic.

training	Eric Harris	Eric Harris	They pulled off the hand-held camera, perfectly.It reminds us of April 20th, 1999, when Eric Harris, and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves.
training	Eric Freeman	Eric Freeman	Eric Freeman's ridiculously over-the-top acting
training	Eric Christmas	Eric Christmas	Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. This cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
training	Eric Braeden	Eric Braeden	███████████ is brilliant and matched action for action with the entire cast in low-key masterpiece about dangers of unchecked scientific advances.
training	Eric Bogosian	Eric Bogosian	"I tend to be inclined towards movies about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship, and express what they really want to express. Eric Bogosian's character of Barry is like Howard Stern, but much more intelligent. The character itself is very fascinating. As an Oliver Stone film, I guess I was expecting more. The film sags a bit during the third act. Plus, it's pretty obvious that ""Talk Radio"" is based on a play, with its long dialogue scenes. But overall, the film works. Bogosian is great in the lead, and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the movie was based on probably helped him. If you want to check out one of Stone's greater films, I better suggest you check out ""JFK"" or ""Salvador."" This is not his best work, but a good movie nonetheless."
training	Ennio Morricone	Ennio Morricone	From the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no man's land battle scenes with poison gas and German cavalry in full gas proof 'storm trooper' gear, this is a movie that should not be missed.
training	Emma Roberts	Emma Roberts	I thought Emma Roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been
training	Emma Dunn	Emma Dunn	Emma Dunn as a sob sister reporter
training	Emma	Emma	I especially enjoyed the performance of the Emma character. Well done! The stunts were pretty good for a low budget show.
training	Emily Watson	Emily Watson	Emily Watson is amazing in this, as well as the actor who plays the main character.
training	Emily Watson	Emily Watson	This movie stars Emily Watson, of Breaking the Waves fame.
training	Emily Watson	Emily Watson	I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves.
training	Emily Watson	Emily Watson	A chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by Emily Watson.
training	Emily Rose	Emily Rose	You're much better off just watching The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose.
training	Emily Posa	Emily Posa	He then contacts Emily Posa, a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. He spends time with her, weeding her garden and fixing her rare Heidelberg printer. He begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation
training	Emilio Miraglio's	Emilio Miraglio's	"Emilio Miraglio's ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I have ever seen."
training	Emilio Miraglio	Emilio Miraglio	Emilio Miraglio's The Red Queen Kills Seven Times (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed. First of all, and of paramount importance for me, it has a complex, twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end
training	Emile Zola	Emile Zola	This movie reminds me of Irréversible (2002), another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature I did not like the movie but I cannot say that it is a bad movie, it is just special I reminds me also of Camping Cosmos (1996) where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism I did not like the movie and I also do not like the people who are in it They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will Or you could say: the hell is on this world.
training	Emil Sitka	Emil Sitka	Emil Sitka provides excellent support in his role.
training	Elvis	Elvis	The film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s, you know the wholesome decade when they danced to Elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it.
training	Elvira	Elvira	There is a sign that Elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of Kansas.
training	Elvira	Elvira	Hey HULU.com is playing the Elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the Name Monsteroid, good fun to watch comment on this Crappy movie ....Have Fun with bad movies. Anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70's were for horror flicks Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just bad movie making. Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it. While you are at HULU check out the other movies that are their right now there is 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection.
training	Elmyra	Elmyra	They NEVER paired the mice with Elmyra--no, never!!
training	Elmer Bernstein	Elmer Bernstein	She was gorgeous! Loved the jazz score by Elmer Bernstein!
training	Elliot	Elliot	The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. The latest episode when our favorite grumpy, Jesus-loving Nurse Roberts dies Dr. Cox shaves his head. The must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity. For shame, Scrubs. They've made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show needs to step it up.
training	Ellen Page	Ellen Page	The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co-stars in this movie She does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role I don't consider it a supporting role
training	Ella Raines	Ella Raines	Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.

training	Elizbeth Von Arnim	Elizbeth Von Arnim	My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book.
training	Elizabeth Taylor	Elizabeth Taylor	This is a delightful film. Elizabeth Taylor does a wonderful job, as does Mickey Rooney. The film just makes you feel happy. It's inspirational, and even though some parts are a bit overly sentimental, that is easily forgiven. I could watch this movie again and again. The race at the end is exciting every time I see it. Highly recommend this film.

training	Elaine	Elaine	"My reaction to that one was the same as Elaine's on Seinfeld: ""It sucked."
training	Ekin Cheng	Ekin Cheng	Tsui Hark's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie. Unfortunately the terrible acting by Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the urge to strangle her while watching this, it's that bad :) made it difficult to watch at times.
training	Ekin Cheng	Ekin Cheng	This movie practically all computer generated. The acting is superb, as always expected from such high profile players. Ekin Cheng makes an excellent protagonist, loner character. Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this movie.
training	Edward Furlong	Edward Furlong	i feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago..
training	Edward Furlong	Edward Furlong	That made me thinking-again!- How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project?
training	Edward Everett Horton	Edward Everett Horton	Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, I was also waxing nostalgic about it...before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched 'special effects'. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release. Judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.
training	Edmund Purdom	Edmund Purdom	The result was a wonderful movie. Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating. Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE, Edmund Purdom took his place --- with Lanza's voice dubbed in, and with the formerly handsome and not-fat Lanza pictured in the advertising. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $2.00 or less. Don't be put off by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.
training	Edmund Cobb	Edmund Cobb	In addition to those mentioned above, J.C. Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence..  A classic western in every sense of the word.
training	Edith Bouvier Beale	Edith Bouvier Beale	Fascinating yet unsettling look at ██████████████████ (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric.

training	Dylan O'Leary	Dylan O'Leary	The title says it all. I'm not a film critic nor will I act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie. Obviously this movie didn't have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great! It looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie!

training	Dreyfuss	Dreyfuss	From there, Dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator, all the while balancing it with his own life.. Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into comedy?

training	Dostoyevsky	Dostoyevsky	"If you liked Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment,"" you will probably like this if only for the comparisons."
training	Dorothy	Dorothy	The appeal of the actors are what really put it over(John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten are particularly good.) Go ahead and rent or buy this movie you'll be glad you did.

training	Donkey Kong	Donkey Kong	Everything from the speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realistic.The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.

training	Donald Trump	Donald Trump	Donald Trump is perfect as the boss, even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity. He also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire, which is one of the negatives about the show.
training	Donald Sutherland	Donald Sutherland	Went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC and I absolutely loved the film!!! I am Diane's #1 biggest fan and of course, as always, she gave a magnificent performance!! I have seen every single one of her movies and I must say that this is one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and moving and just took my breath away. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly humorous but also a good amount of serious. Anton Yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and gave an amazing performance. All in all, I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate an excellent movie. 10 thumbs up!!! I would definitely go see it again and again and again. This is the best film of the year so far!!!
training	Donald Sutherland	Donald Sutherland	The film has a great cast, starring Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. Naval Officer Quinn is a reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a chance meeting with Kingsley who believes Quinn to be the famous terrorist Carlos the Jackal.
training	Donald Sutherland	Donald Sutherland	The actors Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn gave a top performance.
training	Donald Sutherland	Donald Sutherland	"Strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle-aged man (William H. Macy) who finally decides to leave the family business (murder for hire) run by his quietly over-demanding father (Donald Sutherland) while seeing a shrink (John Ritter) and flirting with another patient (Neve Campbell).  Talk about a major dilemma, but ""Panic"" is a top-notch thriller that looks like ""American Beauty"" meets ""The Professional""."
training	Donald Sutherland	Donald Sutherland	Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of the C.I.A.
training	Donald Sutherland	Donald Sutherland	"Add a crazed agent(Donald Sutherland) who is looking for the worlds most notorious terrorist and add a Ben Kingsley and you have ""The Assignment""."
training	Donald Moffat	Donald Moffat	Donald Moffat is too one-note as his father-in-law.

training	Don Gallico	Don Gallico	Price portrays Don Gallico, a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by the lovely Eva Gabor).
training	Don Bluth	Don Bluth	Don Bluth has always been a good movie maker.
training	Don Baker	Don Baker	Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material, and almost always under appreciated.
training	Dominic Monaghan	Dominic Monaghan	The acting of Dominic Monaghan is simply fantastic, As a part insomniac myself, I can relate with how the story develops.
training	Dolls	Dolls	Guys and Dolls is a movie itching for a remake.

training	Dick Francis	Dick Francis	Yorkshire Television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'The Racing Game'.
training	Dick Cavett	Dick Cavett	Let us not forget Johnny Winters as the CIA agent and the several guest stars playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett -- all perfectly done.. All in all, a memorable romp under the Paradorian moon.. -R.
training	Dianne Keaton	Dianne Keaton	As I sat subjected to this televised mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this trash? The movie uses meaningless, contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands.
training	Diane Wiest	Diane Wiest	Diane Wiest co-stars.
training	Diane Ladd	Diane Ladd	I first saw this movie on the Lifetime Television network after hearing some good reviews and seeing previews. The plot follows Gracie(Kristen Bell), a 17 year old girl who deals with trying to keep her brothers from being taken away from her and put into foster homes due to her drug-addicted and often absent mother Rowena(Anne Heche). With stunning performances from both Bell and Heche as the daughter and mother duo the film has real edge. With the supporting cast including Diane Ladd, this television movie surpasses the stereotypes of a typical movie-of-the-week. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be inspired by a true story set to the screen.
training	Diane	Diane	Diane and I saw this fabulous film today in Fremantle and we both agreed that of the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest I say that because we were entranced by the brief, five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many forms.
training	Diane	Diane	Not real; appears only in Diane's dream sequence.
training	Diagnosis Murder	Diagnosis Murder	I'm a writer working at home and Diagnosis Murder is my lunchtime break companion - good, clean fun, good humour and nostalgia for the days of the Dick van Dyke show.

training	Dev Anand	Dev Anand	Performance by Dev Anand prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the minutest detail.
training	Dev Anand	Dev Anand	"An excellent thriller of all time. Vijay Anand excels as Director and Editor. Performances by Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the minutest detail. Cinematography adds to the mystery, glamour and other requirements of the story as it evolves. And to top it all, music by Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable. ""Yeh dil na hota bechara"" by Kishore Kumar, ""Raat akeli hai"" by Asha Bhosle, ""Rula ke gaya sapna mera"" by Lata, ""Aasman ke niche"" by Lata and Rafi and ""Hothon pe aisi baat main"" by Lata, again reaffirm Burman Dada's unique stature as a top notch composer with a style of his own."
training	Detective Antoine	Detective Antoine	Everything becomes clear, but only with time and Detective Antoine's persistence.
training	Des Brady	Des Brady	It's just one of those films, you're either love it or hate it, my girlfriend and me loved it, told my brother to rent it and he hated it, said it was too flashy and colloquial, then again he only usually goes to see big action movies, so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. There were some great new talent (I'd never heard of the leads before anyway)? Des Brady (the directors brother?) was especially good. Playing a right dick at the start I thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end I was really routing for him. A very surprising film with a whole lot of heart, if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original. Yashimo. Brixton in the UK.
training	Derrida	Derrida	The questions asked to Derrida were general, inane questions with not a single followup.
training	Denzel Washington	Denzel Washington	This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I had already anticipated. It was definitely a heart-wrenching spectacular movie. It is an amazing story, with amazing actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (shouldn't surprise anyone) Derek Luke did a wonderful job as well.
training	Denton	Denton	As the sadistic gunman who enjoys kicking Denton around
training	Dennis Quaid	Dennis Quaid	Dennis Quaid█tries his best as the Secret Service agent trying to quell his demonsion
training	Dennis Patrick	Dennis Patrick	Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a bigot who is getting drunk there, at first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed on the evening news. Instead of calling the cops or the like, Joe decides that, since the guy killed a hippie, they must be kindred spirits! He blackmails the man into becoming his pal. At first, the film seemed harsh and judgemental, but, as it revealed itself, it actually became quite a complex portrait of the current society. Yes, I think it does exaggerate a bit, but in amusing ways that don't really detract from the power of its messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this film, and it's a shock to see how pretty she was around 23. Well worth seeing.
training	Dennis Leary	Dennis Leary	What a crime that two of them are already dead, It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever.

training	Dennis Hopper	Dennis Hopper	"Dennis Hopper (on the comeback trail with this, ""Blue Velvet"", and ""Hoosiers"") gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation leftover."
training	Dennis Hopper	Dennis Hopper	"Fans of this movie are advised to check out a Canadian film from 1981 called ""Out of the Blue"", directed by Dennis Hopper."
training	Deniz Akkaya	Deniz Akkaya	The only nice thing about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts.
training	Denise Richards	Denise Richards	Denise Richards on the DVD extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters.
training	Denise Richards	Denise Richards	Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie).
training	Denise Richards	Denise Richards	Denise Richards (the bustiest actress in Hollywood never to star in Baywatch) is especially exploited; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene.
training	Denise Richards	Denise Richards	The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards.
training	Denise Richards	Denise Richards	The appearance of Denise Richards was again a pleasure for the eye.
training	Denholm Elliot	Denholm Elliot	Always one of My favorite novels,I was exteremely pleased with this Television Mini Series. The late, great Denholm Elliot was perfectly cast as the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book,oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story
training	Deneuve	Deneuve	This is one of the best films I have seen in the last years, Deneuve shine as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.

training	Del Toro	Del Toro	Nevertheless, however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been, one thing nobody could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why Del Toro fits the bill only visually.
training	Deepa Mehta's	Deepa Mehta's	Deepa Mehta's somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming.
training	Deepa Mehta's	Deepa Mehta's	"Deepa Mehta's ""Fire"""" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic."
training	Deepa Mehta's	Deepa Mehta's	Two years later, Deepa Mehta's second installment was the element of mother earth, released in India by the name of '1947: Earth',yet another excellent movie by a great director, this time in the Hindi language, unlike 'Fire', which was made in the English language.
training	Deepa Mehta	Deepa Mehta	This is my first Deepa Mehta film.
training	Deepa Mehta	Deepa Mehta	Now Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy, despite a lot of problems, having released the final installment recently, 'Water'.
training	Deepa Mehta	Deepa Mehta	International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial 'Fire', which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist.
training	Deepa Mehta	Deepa Mehta	I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece.
training	Deepa Mehta	Deepa Mehta	By the way, director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood.
training	Deepa Mehta	Deepa Mehta	'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehta's elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998).

training	Debbie Reynolds	Debbie Reynolds	Debbie Reynolds is great, as always.'
training	Debbie Boone	Debbie Boone	The end result is a prefab love story of predictable schlock, all obviously thrown together in a crassly commercial attempt to wring a few more bucks from the contemporary Debbie Boone hit Yep, that's how fast it was produced.
training	Debbie	Debbie	A rather sad bit was when Debbie tried and failed to match her shouty style which spoiled it a bit.
training	Deanna	Deanna	Deanna was so happy.
training	Dean Koontz	Dean Koontz	Dean Koontz really can't write (I read the book at my sister's recommendation, I should have known better).
training	Dead Ringers	Dead Ringers	The cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti.
training	DeVito	DeVito	We see DeVito watching the movie, and a lightbulb in his head pops on.
training	DeCarlo	DeCarlo	DeCarlo goes from bad to good to bad?
training	De Sica	De Sica	Think about it if she were married to De Sica, life would be just as dull and she'd probably be cavorting with Monsier de.
training	De Niro	De Niro	This film will be enjoyed by Fonda and De Niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level.
training	De Niro	De Niro	In the past I've thought De Niro to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy.
training	De Niro	De Niro	Even so, it's a good movie just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!
training	Davy Crockett	Davy Crockett	Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can anyone really play Davy but Fess Parker?
training	Davis	Davis	Davis would become famous for strong performances in films.
training	Davis	Davis	"However, when Julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console each other in their bedroom one night, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion. ""The Matador"" is stylish and energetic."
training	Davis	Davis	Hope Davis really shines in this show. I like the idea of SIX DEGREES...
training	Davis	Davis	"Hope Davis has a small, but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnear's wife (what's with her name ""Bean""?)"
training	Davies	Davies	Exquisite comedy starring Marian Davies (with the affable William Haines).
training	Davies	Davies	A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course learns that is not who she really is.
training	Davidsons	Davidsons	Folks just like the Davidsons inflicted Prohibition and all that went with it on America.Sadie
training	David Zucker	David Zucker	BASEketball is indeed a really funny movie David Zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again
training	David Vaughn	David Vaughn	Subsequently, David Vaughn and his partner Victor are abducted by a bunch of weirdos who take them inside an old bunker where their fellow cult members reside.
training	David Tomlinson	David Tomlinson	Typically of these British films, the cast showcases several established (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and up-and-coming (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) stars, to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell).
training	David Strathairn	David Strathairn	Needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from David Strathairn.
training	David Self	David Self	They screwed up this story! In the end Nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added heads getting chopped, wires cutting peoples faces, and the ceiling turning into a giant hand! What the hell is that about??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost There is no gore There is no ceiling hand It is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person They cannot kill us, they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head No They can only drive us mad Taking away all our senses of security Nell was a selfish woman She only wanted good things for herself Yes, she cared a little for the others, but not too much David Self and Jan de Bont have taken a crap on this great story! I hate this damn remake!
training	David Miller	David Miller	Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. This cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
training	David Lynch	David Lynch	I watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show which I adore.
training	David Julyan	David Julyan	I also thought that the score from David Julyan was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it.
training	David James Elliot	David James Elliot	"Smaller roles by actors such as Jamie Kennedy, Bob Balaban (Posey's costar in ""Waiting For Guffman""), and David James Elliot are also performed with perfection."
training	David Hewlett	David Hewlett	Make the World go away. Get it off my shoulder. Say the things you used to say, and make the World go away. Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a pickle, one for embezzlement, and the other for kissing a child. Neither was guilty, but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down, they ended up in, well, nothing. The whole World, except for their house went away. It is kind of weird, but funny, too. Just what would you do if you were all alone in the world? The two friends just enjoy each other's company, and do what they want.
training	David Hasselhoff's	David Hasselhoff's	There is no way that a movie can be both a tragedy and have someone fart in David Hasselhoff's face.

training	David Bowie	David Bowie	Oh I know, third rate songs that sound like they were made up on the spot David Bowie crones the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight
training	David Bowie	David Bowie	A great sci-fi film and a good cast and music from David Bowie excellent special effects make this film a must to view and have myself seen over 50 times at least surely this must be released on DVD
training	David Boreanaz	David Boreanaz	David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle.
training	David Boreanaz	David Boreanaz	The male characters in the movie were brilliant - David Boreanaz was great as the fickle hunk
training	David Boreanaz	David Boreanaz	In order to have any sense of suspense while watching Valentine, you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming David Boreanaz.
training	David Boreanaz	David Boreanaz	I especially loved David Boreanaz stretching in a part so unlike anything else he played proving once again his amazing gift for comedy.
training	David Baddiel	David Baddiel	I believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making, I'd defend this, the film isn't any worse as a result, and it puts the spotlight on the cast, some of whom are really good (Kate Hardie- think that's her name, as the sarcastic drunk is spot-on) the one exception being David Baddiel, who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff!!
training	David Attenborough	David Attenborough	David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!
training	David Attenborough	David Attenborough	The Direction is outstanding from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film.
training	Dave Grohl	Dave Grohl	What I was most surprised about was Dave Grohl as Satan That is f-ing hilarious.
training	Dave Goelz	Dave Goelz	The first feature length Muppet Movie, and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol, the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos, keeps to a simple but original plot, classic Muppet lame jokes, Paul Williams genius in song writing, and Electric Mayhem madness, and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with puppets. Half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor/actress still alive???? I can only hope Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive Kermit and Company from the deadly grasp of Disney.
training	Dave	Dave	Paul was totally ripped off by someone at paramount who made Dave.
training	Dave	Dave	Paul was totally ripped off by someone at paramount who made Dave.
training	Dassin	Dassin	The characters aren't the most sympathetic and the women are mostly weak, but Dassin still builds an extremely well-crafted suspense film out of them as they pull off a heist that requires the utmost quiet, hide the goods, and then attempt to survive what basically becomes a cross-country cat and mouse game.
training	Daryl Hannah	Daryl Hannah	Sometimes Daryl Hannah can seem a little spacy in her film roles, but its exactly that quality that makes her so perfect in the part of Madison.
training	Darth Vader	Darth Vader	His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate.
training	Darren Stein	Darren Stein	Darren Stein is a director.
training	Darren Stein	Darren Stein	One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies.

training	Dark Heart	Dark Heart	Than the club & cousin bears have grown up to get ready to fight Dark Heart.
training	Dario Argento	Dario Argento	Even though it's part of Italian giallo; which is far from being a slasher sub-genre.Dario Argento proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in Horror.
training	Danny Glover	Danny Glover	The story itself was incredible but came alive by Spielberg's expertise and the fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery.
training	Danny Glover	Danny Glover	It displays the amazing acting abilities of Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Danny Glover.
training	Danny	Danny	Danny is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him.

training	Danny	Danny	The skilled use of innovative resources (like stills stitching Danny's memories into the film) will compare to those hand-made pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable.

training	Danielle Harris	Danielle Harris	plus a chance to check out the gorgeous Danielle Harris
training	Danielle Cormack	Danielle Cormack	Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show. You shouldn't take all the show seriously, but if you wanna have fun, that's your TV show. Being made by the producers of Xena is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 isn't that different from Xena. The female warriors formula is brought to the future, where they don't have to fight warriors or gods, but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface, and the humans are forced to live underground. Along the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They all are different, but as a team, they work really well. The three main actresses appeared previously in Xena, like most of the regular/guest cast (there are some known faces from Hercules too, or from both shows). I specially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from any of her roles I previously knew.
training	Daniel Roebuck	Daniel Roebuck	The best performance however is definitely Daniel Roebuck.
training	Daniel	Daniel	Daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into the lives of the simple, warm and rough people of the North.
training	Dani Behr	Dani Behr	he best performances weren't anything to do with acting. In fact probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people, although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary.
training	Dane Cook	Dane Cook	I have to let you know, I'm not a huge fan of either Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really had no expectations going into this.
training	Dandy Warhols	Dandy Warhols	Excellent documentary, ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two West Coast retro rock'n'roll bands: The Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre.
training	Dancer	Dancer	Four of them, The Element of Crime, Europa, Breaking the Waves, and Dancer in the Dark, I have given a 10, and one, The Idiots, I have given a 9 (and I have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since I first saw it, although I'd like to see it once more before I do).
training	Dancer	Dancer	And news are: Marvellous labyrinthine spectacle! For any Von Trier's follower: both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in The Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc... Europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms.
training	Dan Duryea	Dan Duryea	It's a rare opportunity to see veteran character actor Dan Duryea play a nice guy
training	Dan Castellanetta	Dan Castellanetta	I remember having a Megavolt action figure, I don't remember what happened to him, but when I found out he was voiced by Dan Castellanetta (Homer Simpson), I really, really wanted that action figure back!
training	Damon Runyon	Damon Runyon	I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth reminding people of the everloving genius of Damon Runyon.
training	Damon Runyon	Damon Runyon	I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth reminding people of the everloving genius of Damon Runyon.
training	Damon	Damon	Damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity.
training	Damme	Damme	Van Damme should be pleased that Derailed is no longer the worst film ever, and what was with the ending?
training	Dalton	Dalton	Both Dalton and Clarke are very believable as Rochester and Jane.
training	Dale Midkiff	Dale Midkiff	But there are some other flaws though in the other casting; Dale Midkiff is good, not great, as the conflicted, disturbed father figure Creed, and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all. In terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces, only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil, it does involve a cool Ramones song), and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one), including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining.
training	DCI Red Metcalfe	DCI Red Metcalfe	Hopefully we have not seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe.
training	D'Onofrio	D'Onofrio	Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all. This is where the film gets all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st-Century CGI update of Dr Who's kaleidoscopic favourite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place, ruled over by D'Onofrio, now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body.
training	Cut	Cut	Cut was original, scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun I'd give it seven out of ten
training	Cut	Cut	Personally, I enjoyed Cut thouroughly It was the first time I've seen a theatrically release Australian slasher flick
training	Curtis Wayne	Curtis Wayne	And for those Bo Bice fanatics out there - actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will make you do a double take.
training	Curtis	Curtis	I suspect that his being cast in the Curtis role had something to do with why the aforementioned concentration camp scene was cut.
training	Cristina Raines	Cristina Raines	Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead, and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next-door neighbor.
training	Cristina Marsillach	Cristina Marsillach	And a main reason why Argentos becoming one of my favorites.The acting from most of the cast was alright, but the best by far was Cristina Marsillach as the tortured young opera singer Betty.
training	Crispin Glover	Crispin Glover	Crispin Glover, while always entertaining to watch, seems a bit out of place as the manic stoner and leader of the group.
training	Craze	Craze	From what I can gather, Craze seemed to be about the crazy antiques dealer who prays to an African statue and sacrifices people to it.
training	Craven	Craven	"A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck.""Mirage"" is obviously inspired by Spielberg's ""Duel"" and Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes"".Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.The film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.There is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.The acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak,but the film is fast-paced and shocking.B.G.Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.Overall,if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10."
training	Craig Sheffer	Craig Sheffer	For one, Craig Sheffer is not a likable hero.
training	Craig Brewer	Craig Brewer	It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos.
training	Coxism State	Coxism State	"I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment...*sigh*). It was nice to see Cox outside of the incessantly brittle ""Coxism State"" he is in these days, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase/or is that Matthew Perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already acknowledged on Conan). A little side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance montage was ""Diner"" by Martin Sexton."
training	Cox	Cox	The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. The latest episode when our favorite grumpy, Jesus-loving Nurse Roberts dies. For shame, Scrubs. They've made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show needs to step it up.
training	Cox	Cox	"I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment...*sigh*).

training	Cowell	Cowell	"Even more, giving it is an open talent contest, half of them are singers what gives Cowell a chance for a shot closer to the ""Idol"" success."
training	Costner	Costner	I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film.
training	Costa Dillon	Costa Dillon	Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. This cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
training	Cosi Fabian	Cosi Fabian	In the sex section, Cosi Fabian, a 'sacred prostitute', was beautiful.
training	Corey Feldman	Corey Feldman	this is a great movie for all Corey Feldman fans. This movie has a great cast of young actors. a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash, but all goes wrong when a security gaurd gets shot and they take hostages
training	Corey Feldman	Corey Feldman	This film was so well-paced that I don't think I actually blinked while watching. One intense situation after another kept me glued to the set. However, I would have liked to have seen Corey Feldman a lot more in this picture. He just steals every scene that he is in. This could be my favorite grown up Corey performance. The ending was clever and unlike other films which back away from severing body parts of likeable supporting characters, this film goes for it! I liked that it was not graphic blood and gore but left more to the viewer's imagination. Bravo. I literally had to wipe sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter. Ultimately, the film works because of its likeable lead character and the awesome presence of my all-time favorite bad guy, James Remar(48 Hours, remember?) I strongly recommend this film for anyone looking to break a sweat.
training	Corey	Corey	In fact, I found myself rooting for Corey since I felt the idiots deserved to die for their behaviors!
training	Corbin Bernsen	Corbin Bernsen	There are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and beauty queen fondling, as well as a marvelously deranged performance by Corbin Bernsen.
training	Corbin Bernsen	Corbin Bernsen	There are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and beauty queen fondling, as well as a marvelously deranged performance by Corbin Bernsen The scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch.
training	Conrad Veidt	Conrad Veidt	"Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. ""The Thief of Bagdad"" was my favorite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me. I loved this film from the first moment I saw it, when I was a boy of six who had started reading ""The Arabian Nights."" I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled. Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros, ███████████ is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie."
training	Conchatta Ferrell	Conchatta Ferrell	No one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department Conchatta Ferrell is just wonderful She is an example of the strong, persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land.
training	Conan	Conan	This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better. It almost were. With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger..., music almost like in, say, Conan... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart of John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before-mentioned Crouching Tiger... I am really ashamed of poor old John. He is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better. So as you - so if you still have a chance just watch something else.
training	Conan	Conan	A great alternative to another short story about Conan the Barbarian, but not to a novel.
training	Columbo	Columbo	The script for this Columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera.
training	Columbo	Columbo	Most definitely the worst Columbo ever dreamt up No murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag.
training	Colin Farrel	Colin Farrel	it was a very gritty movie, through and through.In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's better movies (if not his top performance).
training	Cole Wlikerson	Cole Wlikerson	Brian Keith as Cole Wlikerson and Richard Jaeckel as Wade Matlock make excellent villains.
training	Cody	Cody	The alien creature was unreal And the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight And to make it worse the guy named Cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film.
training	Cleese	Cleese	I watched this entire train wreck but only so that I wouldn't later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part.
training	Claudio Carvalho	Claudio Carvalho	Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could.
training	Claudia Black	Claudia Black	I would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if Claudia Black had not continued on in it! Her inclusion as the silly 'Vela' has brought the series down in my estimation.
training	Claudette Colbert	Claudette Colbert	The plot of the film has been used in others in different ways, however one must acknowledge that acting of Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert added another quality to this drama. At present Black and white films are not much wanted, particularly by new generations, but the present can be well accepted by them. It goes step by step with an acting of Welles simply extraordinary, the way he moves the way he talks and argues in the film is nearly normal. The end was logic and obviously tragic. We would need more materials like these, i.e. with less violence and good humanistic messages.
training	Claude Rains	Claude Rains	I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, notwithstanding its base in a true story, its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him.
training	Claude Rains	Claude Rains	Curtiz made sure no scene, soapy or otherwise, went on too long.In addition to the Lane sisters and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (who adds much-needed humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (the main love interest of the girls), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson.Apparently, this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin-offs from it, neither of them approaching this one in content and box-office success.
training	Claude Lelouch	Claude Lelouch	The Claude Lelouch's movie is a pretty good moment of cinema. One of the most touching films about family and loneliness, and surely the best interpretation of French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo.
training	Claude Lelouch	Claude Lelouch	Director Claude Lelouch whips up an appropriately dusty, windswept scenario, and the film's keenly observed atmosphere is bracing and real.
training	Clarrissa Explains All	Clarrissa Explains All	"I remember first watching Sabrina when it came to TV in the UK on ITV1 when i was 13/14. I'm now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it. I get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a ""kids show"" but i don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as ""Hilda"" is my personal favourite character and Later on Morgan also became another of my favourite characters. I remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring Sabrina on the TV station Nickeleoden UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great in ""Clarrissa Explains All"" but so much better in this. I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK - I'll be first in line! lol x"
training	Clarke	Clarke	Both Dalton and Clarke are very believable as Rochester and Jane.
training	Clark Gable	Clark Gable	In this film he played the weak brother and was completely over-shadowed by Joan Crawford and the dynamic newcomer Clark Gable - maybe that was why he never became a star.
training	Clarence Williams III	Clarence Williams III	Harry's blackmailed by a trio of scummy low-life hoods -- sleazy porno theater manager Raimy (a splendidly slimy John Glover), antsy strip joint owner Leo (well played by Robert Trebor) and crazed pimp Bobby Shy (a frightfully intense Clarence Williams III) -- who have videotaped his affair with Cini.
training	Clare Wren	Clare Wren	Michael Bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (the creepy Ray Wise) at a sprawling, windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young, scheming and seductive stepmother from hell (the yummy Clare Wren), thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family. An edgy, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to VHS and cable TV--where I first saw it. It is beautifully written, smartly acted, and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails. I cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it. It is an undiscovered classic.
training	Clara Calamai	Clara Calamai	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely interesting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans."
training	Claire Danes	Claire Danes	Then again, that was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the foolish, arrogant, Hollywood-ized bitch she is today.
training	Claire Danes	Claire Danes	Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection.

training	Cinderella	Cinderella	Like SWINGSHIFT Cinderella, however, the old lady grandma in this case is dead set on catching the wolf herself and does everything she can do to thwart the wolf from capturing Red.
training	Cillian Murphy	Cillian Murphy	Cillian Murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain.
training	Cillian Murphy	Cillian Murphy	We are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly, even charismatic killer.
training	Ciaran Hinds	Ciaran Hinds	(IMO the newer A&E production suffers in that Ciaran Hinds - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout.

training	Chuck Roberson	Chuck Roberson	In addition to those mentioned above, J.C. Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence..  A classic western in every sense of the word.
training	Chuck Norris	Chuck Norris	I've always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in film. Although the acting may not be superb, the fight scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills perform along side him. In my opinion, the brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production! I hope you take the time to view this movie!

training	Christopher Walken	Christopher Walken	"I enjoyed two of the three movies in the ""Sarah, Plain & Tall"" trilogy. This, the final of the three, was definitely one of the ""good ones. "" It is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. The storyline is simple but well-told. The only sub-par performance was by one of the kids. It was interesting to see how the kids had grown since that first movie. Of the three, that initial ""Sarah,"" was the best- filmed with some beautiful cinematography. This movie didn't have that, but it had the best story. It had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending. Highly recommended."
training	Christopher Monger	Christopher Monger	Adrian Pasdar is very believable as Gerald/Geraldine and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting. The directing of Christopher Monger is very sensitively, treating such a difficult issue quite excellently, packed into a good story
training	Christopher Lee	Christopher Lee	I actually have a fondness for Christopher Lee, but this just wasn't up to his other performances.. and he was one of the better actors. The film does not live up to its premise It's not that scary, it's overly melodramatic, and it draaaaaags Every time I thought, Oh, HERE comes the good part the good part never quite arrived. The Evil Ones aren't at all convincing Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth. Perhaps if I'd been in the proper frame of mind, I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at this film's expense, but... Naaahhh.. Didn't really seem to be worth the effort It wasn't really very good, it wasn't really very bad, it was just mediocre.

training	Christopher	Christopher	"The production quality, cast, premise, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) locale and lush Christopher██ score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item.

training	Chris Sarandon	Chris Sarandon	Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem, not by a long shot
training	Chris Sarandon	Chris Sarandon	BEWARE SPOILERS. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it.Okay, so the goofie foreign guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny. This guy's boss was good, too. But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have had a lot more time on screen together. They're chemistry was great. The bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic, sweet, yummy. Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians. To talk about Sarandon would be to give a lot away. SPOILERS This is a rather untypical romantic/political comedy, and it satisfies both somewhat-the political side a whole lot more than the romantic. It touches on political issues, and just barely skims on romantic areas.
training	Chris Gunn	Chris Gunn	"""Tracks"" is supposed to be about young teenagers 14 to 16 years of age being tried as adults and placed in an adult jail. Chris Gunn just doesn't look the part. He is too old, and this deprives the film of any impact. America has a reputation of being cruel towards juveniles. There is the possibility of a story along these lines, but the film doesn't manage to come across. There is a sexual harassment scene, and a couple of fights - almost compulsory stereotypes in this sort of story. But it is boring, boring, boring. The 'David and Goliath' factor, where a young and fragile hero goes up against a powerful brute villain is missing completely. There must be many young teenage actors who could do the part successfully. ""Salems Lot"" and ""Dune"" had the same problem. When will producers learn?"

training	Charles S. Dutton	Charles S. Dutton	The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).

training	Chaplin	Chaplin	until now only preferring silent comedic standards by Keaton, Chaplin
training	Chaplin	Chaplin	"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ending their career together. Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years. Not as ""raunchy"" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In the Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another. Not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough. Although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy."
training	Chaplin	Chaplin	I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, notwithstanding its base in a true story, its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him.

training	Chamberlain	Chamberlain	Is it because it's from 1975 and has Chamberlain and Curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling?  Maybe it's because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book? (I have not read the book, but I don't think that's a problem, film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book).

training	Cassidy	Cassidy	"This was the first televised episode of the Columbo series (although it was filmed after ""Death Lends a Hand"")and it heralded one of the most successful TV series in history.  Jack Cassidy (who played the murderer in the series three times) enthuses smugness, arrogance and self-assuredness in equal measure here, as Ken Franklin, one half of a mystery writing team who hatches an elaborate plot to kill off his partner, Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to terminate their professional relationship, leaving Franklin exposed as merely a good publicist rather than a prolific writer.  The initial murder set-up is fantastic and Cassidy's performance facilitates an arguable accolade that he was the best Columbo murderer in the series.  Peter Falk is wonderfully understated in his role as Columbo and the character's inherent traits and oddities, which are underlined by a seeming slowness and absent-mindedness, contrast particularly well with Cassidy's character's extreme smugness: one of their early scenes together where Ken Franklin fabricates a motive for the killing through Jim Ferris's non-existent expo-see of identifying hit-men operating in the underworld exemplifies this very well."
training	Casper	Casper	The acting styles ran the gamut from really, really, flat (the angels, the wife and daughter) to over-animated (Casper's character).
training	Cary Grant	Cary Grant	I decided to watch this film because I love Cary Grant and eventually I want to see every film he made.
training	Carrie-Anne Moss	Carrie-Anne Moss	The Animatrix: A Detective Story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity in this animated cartoon. I really like the 'Private Detective' ideas created by the Director.
training	Carrie	Carrie	"You can see this movie as ""Ringu"" meets ""Carrie"", since this movie story- and character-wise definitely show some similarities to the Brian De Palma horror classic ""Carrie"", from 1976."
training	Carrey's	Carrey's	Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10
training	Caroline Rhea	Caroline Rhea	"I remember first watching Sabrina when it came to TV in the UK on ITV1 when i was 13/14. I'm now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it. I get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a ""kids show"" but i don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as ""Hilda"" is my personal favourite character and Later on Morgan also became another of my favourite characters. I remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring Sabrina on the TV station Nickeleoden UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great in ""Clarrissa Explains All"" but so much better in this. I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK - I'll be first in line! lol x"

training	Carlos	Carlos	Lets say Carlos training is right up there with the academy of arts and holocausts.
training	Carlos	Carlos	"An excellent ""sleeper"" of a movie about the search for Carlos the international assassin. Am surprised this film didn't rake in $100-million-plus because it's much better than most films that do so. Rent it NOW."
training	Carlos	Carlos	Also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent Carlos is.
training	Carlito	Carlito	Carlito's Way Rise to Power 1 out of 10.
training	Carla	Carla	Probably the best film of the year for me. This small French film centers on put upon office secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) who spends her days doing other men's jobs, uncredited, and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as, being partially deaf, she reads lips. A change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con Paul (Vincent Cassel) as her assistant. The relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film. Mutual dependency, for vastly different reasons, bonds them. Carla becomes attracted to Paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for,what seems like,the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help. He owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve Carlas' skill of reading lips. I think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense/drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the whole film, no matter what other characters are on screen, you can feel this amazing bond between Carla and Paul. I cannot remember when I have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the French Cesar for best actress). You never feel like you are watching a piece of acting, this really is Carla. The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. He makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive. I loved this film because of these two people, and both times when I had finished watching it I wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again.
training	Carl Schenkel	Carl Schenkel	Psycho criminal pure by Carl Schenkel, who is active in Hollywood, like Mrs Soutendijk. Goetz George and Hannes Jaenicke are stealing the spectator's last peace of snugness. They are too able, how can I get calm into a lift next time ?

training	Camelia Kath	Camelia Kath	And as for Camelia Kath, I've seen better looking scarecrows in farmer's fields.
training	Calvin	Calvin	This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards. Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life.
training	Caleb Deschanel	Caleb Deschanel	In addition to the well-known artists listed, t also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment about Pixar Animation Studios.
training	Caleb	Caleb	It was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot, the characters in the show were great as well, and complimented one another well. I was sorry to see it cut off.. I would have loved to see where it could have went.You found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was frightening and alluring. And I would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became. I will however buy the show just to enjoy, it was great to something different on TV. And Paige Turrco who was Caleb's cousin.
training	Cait Sith	Cait Sith	Cait Sith sounds less cute than I imagined, but worked very well.
training	Cait Sith	Cait Sith	All your favorite characters are there, even Cait Sith.
training	Caine	Caine	If Caine were some twenty year old hothead you might be able to buy it, but a man in his late sixties
training	Cage	Cage	The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: Anderson, Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts, with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee's merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri, Viveca Lindfors as Theirry's wise, perceptive mother Tatta, Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack, and Steve Buscemi as a funny, blithely shameless thief.
training	Cage	Cage	In my opinion, this film has wonderful lighting and even better photography. Too bad the story is not all that good and Mr. Cage sometimes loses his accent. But two thumbs up for lighting and the DP!
training	Byron Calhoun	Byron Calhoun	He just doesn't look or act like a small-town Southern lawman named Byron Calhoun.

training	Busby Berkley	Busby Berkley	Such energy and vitality You just can't go wrong with Busby Berkley films and this certainly must be his best Of course the choreography is wonderful, but also the banter between Cagney and Blondell is so colorful and such a delight Don't miss this one.
training	Burton	Burton	Burton mumbles his lines, including the word BOOM several times
training	Burton	Burton	as her nasty dwarf security guard...both he and his dogs do a number on Burton!
training	Burton	Burton	If anything, Burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in depicting Wood-ian dialogue.
training	Burton	Burton	Again, Burton dramatises her reaction to seeing the script for the first time, whereas the film portrays her as being accepting and forward-thinking.
training	Burt Reynolds	Burt Reynolds	This is a hilarious film. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship contract with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it, such as forcing Burt to wear a chicken suit during the race! Jim Nabors is his (not quite convincing) chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh, yeah!) is assigned by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and strictly adhering to the contract. This is a funny film in which Burt proves that he ain't too proud. I like it!
training	Burt Reynolds	Burt Reynolds	They soon realize that Boss Hogg is gonna strip-mine Hazzard County, unless the Dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, Daisy. My only two problems with the movie was that Burt Reynolds wasn't right for the part of Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was way too serious. Other than that, I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD!!!
training	Burt Reynolds	Burt Reynolds	It's a beautiful, bittersweet movie about a misfit Charlie (fantasticaly voiced by Burt Reynolds) who is killed by his boss/partner in crime.
training	Burt Reynolds	Burt Reynolds	I may be wrong, but this is the last film where I considered Burt Reynolds an actual actor, who transformed the role, and delivered a message.
training	Burt Reynolds	Burt Reynolds	I may be wrong, but this is the last film where I considered Burt Reynolds an actual actor, who transformed the role, and delivered a message.
training	Burt Reynolds	Burt Reynolds	"I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They're funnier and better than every other movie combined. They might as well have stopped making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's good. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now: there's no point."

training	Bulimia	Bulimia	"Watch it again and ""Forget"" that they are in an ""Office"" setting, focus on the personalities you see in each of the 4 main characters. I'll give you a hint, Lisa Kudrow's character has Bulimia Nervosa. Guess who has OCD? ""Never ignore the Obvious and Never over-look the Obscure"" A great Movie!"

training	Bud Tingwell	Bud Tingwell	Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will, a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death.
training	Buck Henry	Buck Henry	The only honest performance was turned in by Buck Henry, who plays a raving mental patient of course, since he also wrote the screenplay for this abomination, it was probably only typecasting.
training	Brynner	Brynner	Brynner as the egotistic sociopath who is the leader of the cutthroats and Douglas as a man
training	Bryan Forbes	Bryan Forbes	Typically of these British films, the cast showcases several established (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and up-and-coming (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) stars, to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell).
training	Bryan Brown	Bryan Brown	I have seen this film at least 100 times and I am still excited by it, the acting is perfect and the romance between Joe and Jean keeps me on the edge of my seat, plus I still think Bryan Brown is the tops. Brilliant Film.
training	Bryan Adams	Bryan Adams	Well, what can I say, this movie really got to me, it's not so bad, as many say, I really loved it, although the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it isn't First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie Second the simple story
training	Bruno Nicolai	Bruno Nicolai	The film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning, the score by Bruno Nicolai is brilliant, the plot is wonderfully convoluted, and the killer's identity remains a mystery until the end.
training	Bruno Nicolai	Bruno Nicolai	Athens, where most of the film takes place, is actually a great setting for a Giallo. The atmosphere is constantly gripping, and the photography great, and Bruno Nicolai's ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense.
training	Bruce Willis	Bruce Willis	This movie was over-shadowed by 'The Jackal' (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere) which was released the same year.
training	Bruce Willis	Bruce Willis	I'm normally a fan of Bruce Willis, and despite him playing the cold-hearted professional killer, I thought him the most appealing character here That said, his character makes such a mess of his professional activity, it's incredible he hasn't been caught before.
training	Bruce Willis	Bruce Willis	As far as movies about Carlos the Jackal go, this one beats Bruce Willis' feeble efforts in 'The Jackal' to a bloody pulp, then spits on them.
training	Bruce Lee	Bruce Lee	I absolutely loved it, my flatmate and myself (22 year old Biochemistry and Accountancy students) spent the half hour after the film making strange Kung Fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other. I can't explain it (well maybe a little tequila). I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, skinny bloke kicking big bloke, beating him, kicking bigger bloke etc film ends. Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action
training	Bruce Davidson	Bruce Davidson	This movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as the father, but that's not nearly enough to save this stinker A 1 out of 10.
training	Bruce Campbell	Bruce Campbell	"Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages. The movie focuses around ""Fizzy"" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This tv film was just great. The acting is #1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. 10/10"

training	Brosnan	Brosnan	Newbie filmmaker Richard Shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath-of-fresh-air into the 'buddy comedy' formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing Brosnan to get his ya-yas out with devilish glee.
training	Brosnan	Brosnan	It is a wacky film with an unforgettable character, played to perfection by Pierce Brosnan.
training	Brosnan	Brosnan	"Have read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble, ""Facilitator"" ... and is anything but pretty!"
training	Brosnan	Brosnan	Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to behold. Greg Kinnear is the straight guy to Brosnan's comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click.
training	Brosnan	Brosnan	At first I was apprehensive of Brosnan playing a native American

training	Braveheart	Braveheart	Its not Braveheart( thankfully),but it is fine entertainment with engaging characters
training	Brannon Braga	Brannon Braga	The actual show-runner, Brannon Braga, didn't help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous Trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck).
training	Brandon Dicamillo	Brandon Dicamillo	While some of the things in Haggard are dumb and unnecessary, the overall package is good.  Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) trying to win back Glauren (Jenn Rivell), Ryan's ex.  The story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story. And, for all the Bam fan boys (And girls) there are multiple sequences of Bam skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even Don Vito got a bigger (but pointless) roll. If you are hoping to see a comedy and escape Bam's craziness, then stay away from this movie, otherwise, enjoy the time you spend with it, if you can find it. There are some truly funny scenes in this film.
training	Brando	Brando	By some trick of the mind, I ascribed the line to a scene between Brando and Scott instead of Spradlin and Scott.

training	Bozz	Bozz	The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject, and manages to distance itself from usual war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in, spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas, both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war.
training	Boyle	Boyle	The script or the book must have been good - why else would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this dud?
training	Boyle	Boyle	Even with an ensemble cast (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle, and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity, thanks to a plot that starts simple, yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears on The crowning achievement of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character (played by Boyle) who insists on sabotaging the mission.

training	Blue Raja	Blue Raja	Though I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I have read my share, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this film, and I wasn't disappointed. It does run out of steam near the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems like Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting room floor. Also, a little of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun. All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys; somehow, it seemed appropriate.
training	Bled	Bled	But with Bled, what you get is not your conventional vampire flick.
training	Blake Edwards	Blake Edwards	The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical Blake Edwards.
training	Black	Black	This was what black society was like before the crack epidemics, gangsta rap, and AIDS that beset the ghettos in the eighties. Decent, hardworking families that struggled to get by and all the traumas and tribulations they faced. Black America was a different group of people in the seventies. Still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movements of the sixties, times were hard but still worth fighting for. Keepin' your head above water, making a wave when you can, this show showed how black society struggled to work together as people and families, before they started to prey on each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the ghettos. It is heart-breaking to see what the black ghettos were like then and what they have become now.
training	Bjork	Bjork	I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where Bjork's character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction.

training	Billy Wilder	Billy Wilder	This superb film draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are completely at home in the story that apparently was supplied by Billy Wilder█.
training	Billy Crystal	Billy Crystal	The other big surprise was Billy Crystal; I thought I'd find him all wrong as the 1st Gravedigger, but he was his usual funny self while being in character. All in all, a glorious film!
training	Billy Crystal	Billy Crystal	First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique and moving, and even humorous at times. Plus, the location in Czech Republic where parts of the film were shot, was absolutely beautiful. I have to say, this dramatic comedy had me feeling a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
training	Billy	Billy	I was bored, around 10pm, so I watched this movie And I could not stop laughing Everything was so ridiculous The way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up One of the kids had a ring, that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster. It's pretty hard to take little kids seriously, especially when it has to do with eating worms They act like everything is such a big deal, like if Billy (the main character) doesn't eat the worms then the world will end. This is a good movie for little kids (excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis'), but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time.
training	Bill Travers	Bill Travers	Typically of these British films, the cast showcases several established (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and up-and-coming (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) stars, to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell).
training	Bill Smitrovich	Bill Smitrovich	The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).
training	Bill Paxton	Bill Paxton	After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.The film has many twists, and Bill Paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest.
training	Bill Murray	Bill Murray	"This was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughs. Considering the storyline and the lead actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be. Only part of this made me really laugh, such as when Murray lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) The supporting cast was anything but likable people. Just look at a sampling of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role in here as ""Tip Tucker"" was just downright annoying. He was the worst. Other that those people, the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop."

training	Bernard Blier	Bernard Blier	One of the best film I ever saw. The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. He really 'fill' his part, and this is wonderful. He's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to take his part.  And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good as standard french people, trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder... The story is breathtaking and well built. You can feel the ambiance of Paris for that period (which is about 1930-40), between two wars... The clubs, the old little buildings, the neighbors. All those things contribute to make a great movie.
training	Berman	Berman	The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk encounters them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name....need I go on?

training	Bergman	Bergman	In 50 years, when von Trier retires, he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet), and there will be classes taught in his name. He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time.

training	Ben Stiller	Ben Stiller	The acting was what you would expect especially out of Ben Stiller.
training	Ben Stiller	Ben Stiller	"In the history of movies based on comic books, ""Mystery Men"" is one of the most underrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). ""Mystery Men"" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like ""Superman"" or ""Batman,"" such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found ""Mystery Men"" to be visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!"
training	Ben Mezrich	Ben Mezrich	Still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by Ben Mezrich.

training	Ben Affleck	Ben Affleck	I went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when I got in the room There was only me and my girlfriend! This shouted to me that this film is not very good  Not to my surprise, the film was dire Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas It is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him His acting is OKish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good The plot line is poor and the comedy almost non-existent. However, there are some good points For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny. I hope this review stops other people wasting their money I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room!!!
training	Ben	Ben	Ben is very nervous with his new patient, who forces compliments and demands upon him.
training	Ben	Ben	Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who assists in the plan.
training	Bell	Bell	I first saw this movie on the Lifetime Television network after hearing some good reviews and seeing previews. The plot follows Gracie(Kristen Bell), a 17 year old girl who deals with trying to keep her brothers from being taken away from her and put into foster homes due to her drug-addicted and often absent mother Rowena(Anne Heche). With stunning performances from both Bell and Heche as the daughter and mother duo the film has real edge. With the supporting cast including Diane Ladd, this television movie surpasses the stereotypes of a typical movie-of-the-week. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be inspired by a true story set to the screen.
training	Bela Lugosi	Bela Lugosi	I actually enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides, an old hag, and her two bizarre sons, one a giant idiot, the other a comical dwarf(Angelo Rossitto from 1932's Freaks). I also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter, who is kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch.

training	Became	Became	I had an inkling that it would be a bad film, but I KNOW what a truly bad film is after watching greats like Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things and The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies, and now there is truly nothing that fazes me unless it is astoundingly bad Solar Crisis is bad, but it doesn't reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are at Anyway, the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it.

training	Batman	Batman	The art style is OK, but doesn't remind me of Batman anymore.
training	Bartlett	Bartlett	There's no story to speak of, but Bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology.

The story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story. And, for all the Bam fan boys (And girls) there are multiple sequences of Bam skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even Don Vito got a bigger (but pointless) roll.

There are some truly funny scenes in this film.

training	Bad Taste	Bad Taste	"I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie that I'd seen, ""Burning Moon"". But while that movie was rather grim and nasty, ""Premutos"" seems to mostly play it for laughs. While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worthwhile to see this), I found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene. Sure, there's gore, and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition. Many are comparing this to Peter Jackson's movies, especially ""Braindead"". But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in ""Bad Taste"", it's clear Ittenbach is lacking one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and plentiful gore effects, and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)"
training	Bachan	Bachan	I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitab seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.

training	Ashley	Ashley	Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice last to win the first ever Women's Gauntlet match.
training	Ashley	Ashley	"""When in Rome"" was a traditional Mary-Kate and Ashley movie, complete with the foreign travel, accents, motorbikes, adult romance as a ""B"" storyline, fashion orientation, and even the gag reel over the credits."
training	Artimisia	Artimisia	Artimisia was on late last night. At first I didn't think I would like it, but seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. Her romance with the older Tassi envoked recognisable feelings. Even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality, I loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama's. Great play, great camerashots, great music and texts. I loved it and I want more of it! :-)
training	Artemisia	Artemisia	The film of Artemisia may be considered treason, or as true artistic license.  Which might one aver? In documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi was subjected to the thumbscrew, and still affirmed that she was r***ed, as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem have eloquently affirmed. In the movie, under a different torture, she refused to condemn her lover/violator. How may a movie deviate so much from received history, yet still inform the human heart? The answer is not so hard to find. In the movie, the director and cast had filled a gaping hole in the historical record, with the power of imagination. That led to a conclusion that differs from the record. So be it. I find _both_ the record and the movie to be compelling. In both the movie and (it seems) in history, Artemisia was a painter, before all else. For that vision, framed in ravishing (sic) film composition, I am truly grateful. Seldom have I seen a movie that so compelled my eyes. David Broadhurst

training	Armstrong	Armstrong	No, not even for Armstrong, who should have known better.
training	Armin Mueller-Stahl	Armin Mueller-Stahl	good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a particular highlight being Armin Mueller-Stahl's stoic Cardinal.
training	Armand	Armand	Armand was as usual very good in the movie,,,the whole turks vs German thing was kind of strange because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the movie...dint' bother to go back and check...the central theme is about the serial killings with the whole gang warfare loosely woven in.
training	Arkin	Arkin	Arkin shines as always. Check it out; you won't be dissappointed. By the way, it was just released on DVD and contrary to its packaging, it IS widescreen.

training	Archie Mayo	Archie Mayo	"Directed by ██████████ , ""The Petrified Forest"" gave a tremendous boost to a screen career by providing him with a ready-made showcase for his talent."
training	Archibald Cunningham	Archibald Cunningham	Our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the Marquis, and Mary, his wife, suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of Archibald Cunningham, a smarmy Englishman with no soul. Atrocities ensue, until, in an immensely satisfying conclusion, Rob carves Archibald up like a Christmas turkey.
training	Archer	Archer	This ranks as one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Besides Cuba and Angie, the acting is actually embarrassing. Wasn't Archer once a decent actress?
training	Antwone Fisher	Antwone Fisher	Antwone Fisher stands proudly alone in this regard race is irrelevant, save for one fight that may, or may not, have been provoked by a racial slur.
training	Antonioni	Antonioni	Antonioni with Wim Wenders --some of the best of the best. story-character-visuals. Like most of their works, it is not really aimed at the children or the childish. Don't miss the genius contained in this one.
training	Antonio Sabato Jr	Antonio Sabato Jr	I didn't expect much from this TV movie You have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr.
training	Antonio Gades	Antonio Gades	Saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer Antonio Gades and other artists.

training	Antoine	Antoine	My Uncle Antoine is much, much greater than the sum of it's parts.
training	Antoine	Antoine	Inspector Antoine gets the case.
training	Anthony Wong	Anthony Wong	Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord (no suprises there; he makes a cameo in every HK movie).
training	Anthony Steele	Anthony Steele	The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele.
training	Anthony Steel	Anthony Steel	Typically of these British films, the cast showcases several established (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and up-and-coming (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) stars, to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell).
training	Anthony Rapp	Anthony Rapp	The premise is amazing and the some of the acting, notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, is charming... but this film is near unwatchable.

training	Annie Corley	Annie Corley	The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).
training	Annibal Ramirez	Annibal Ramirez	At least that's what he says to guilt US Naval Officer Annibal Ramirez (Quinn again) into taking on the assignment of posing as Carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB.
training	Annibal	Annibal	When Annibal gets his training, you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average American would do in such a situation, ask what the f*** is going on and refusing to cooperate.
training	Annibal	Annibal	The great thing about it is that he really builds up his character (Annibal).
training	Annibal	Annibal	An exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving Ramirez's first name (Annibal, Annabelle, get it?).
training	Annemarie Schwarzenbach	Annemarie Schwarzenbach	I did not have a hint indication who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what was her life story
training	Anne Shirley	Anne Shirley	"Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) had been in films since she was a toddler. By 1933 she was in limbo - having played Ann Dvorak as a child in ""Three on a Match"" (1932) and a ""flower girl"" in both ""This Side of Heaven"" and ""The Key"" both in 1934."
training	Anne Shirley	Anne Shirley	"But the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris-a veteran of Disney's series of ""Alice"" shorts who later would adopt her character's name)."
training	Anne Rice	Anne Rice	The tale was an eye-opener for me, a New Zealander, with no real conception of the black/white lines, let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly. The characters are very three dimensional, and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel, by Anne Rice.
training	Anne Rice	Anne Rice	I thought it'd be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit.
training	Anne Heche	Anne Heche	I first saw this movie on the Lifetime Television network after hearing some good reviews and seeing previews. The plot follows Gracie(Kristen Bell), a 17 year old girl who deals with trying to keep her brothers from being taken away from her and put into foster homes due to her drug-addicted and often absent mother Rowena(Anne Heche). With stunning performances from both Bell and Heche as the daughter and mother duo the film has real edge. With the supporting cast including Diane Ladd, this television movie surpasses the stereotypes of a typical movie-of-the-week. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be inspired by a true story set to the screen.
training	Anne DeSalvo	Anne DeSalvo	I've always knew Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor, now I know she is a great writer/director also.
training	Anne	Anne	Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery's source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story. The movie suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven-year-old that from a teenager.
training	Anne	Anne	"Anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like: ""If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me"". Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard."
training	Anne	Anne	Anne Brontes epic novel THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and peoples living rooms.
training	Anne	Anne	"Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" is a model for this exceptional science fiction film. We look for differences. Prospero and his daughter, Miranda, are stranded on a Mediterranean island."" Morbius and Altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star Altair. Ariel is a spirit. Robby the Robot is a man-made servant. Caliban's evil hardly approaches that of Monsters of the Id. Shakespeare spares Prospero. Morbius dies when Altair 4 blows up. ""The Tempest"" is a comedy. ""Forbidden Planet"" is a tragedy. We wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the Krell in some future time. Anne Francis is Altaira. Jack Kelly is Lieutentant Farman. Kelly starred with James Garner in the comedy/western TV series, ""Maverick."""
training	Anne	Anne	"In fact Anne is the original ""Teenage Drama Queen"" and the film's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character. Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy."
training	Annabelle	Annabelle	An exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving Ramirez's first name (Annibal, Annabelle, get it?).
training	Anita Mui	Anita Mui	He is married for 20 years to Ching (the great Anita Mui, in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us), and it appears to be a loving relationship.
training	Anil Kapoor	Anil Kapoor	The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie. Anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not.

training	Angelina Jolie	Angelina Jolie	█████████████ is spectacular.

training	Angela	Angela	There are some genuinely good moments such as Angela's speech about demons, and the briefly-seen demon itself is effective.
training	Ang Lee	Ang Lee	Ang Lee clearly likes to ease into a film, to catch action, characters and setting on the hoof, as they emerge.
training	Andy Stitzer	Andy Stitzer	In Virgin, Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life.

training	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia truly shows that he is a great actor, and the supporting actors seem more than believable to me.
training	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia is convincing as the haunted psychologist and superb as the grieving father, so much so that it makes for hard viewing.
training	Andy Garcia	Andy Garcia	I like very much the performance of Andy Garcia, I saw him in other two films but now that he is the principal in this movie I think that he should have more opportunities.
training	Andy Clarke	Andy Clarke	I am not sure if Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot, I thought the cinematography was excellent.

training	Andrew Miller	Andrew Miller	"I totally agree that ""Nothing"" is a fantastic film! I've not laughed so much when watching a film for ages! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic in this! they really work well together! This film may not appeal to some people (I can't really say why without spoiling it!) but each to their own! I loved it and highly recommend it! The directing is great and some of the shots are very clever. It looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it! Although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch."
training	Andrew McCarthy	Andrew McCarthy	Andrew McCarthy played the role of an atheist very well. I liked the plot of the movie. It gave something to think about other than a comedy. It had a very twisted mind and a good cop versus God. A very well used plot line.
training	Andrew Hubatsek	Andrew Hubatsek	And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone. And applause goes to whomever did the make-up on Andrew Hubatsek.
training	Andrew Davis	Andrew Davis	seriously i loved this film..i had started to read the book and i loved it...the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose...i think this film did so well was because Louis Sachar wrote the screenplay..and of course Andrew Davis directed it...Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for his first film...the storyline is very cool and interesting...there's humor, heart and intensity...it is very similar to the book..i find this film to be not the least bit boring...i absolutely loved it...and i encourage anyone to read the book..all in all this film is very well put together and carefully crafted...two thumbs up for me in every single way
training	Andrew Davis	Andrew Davis	The minute I started watching this I realised that I was watching a quality production so I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice!
training	Andreas Kunze	Andreas Kunze	Baxter, then, is finally caught attempting to escape to Rio de Janeiro on a plane.Always worth special mention is Andreas Kunze who in this case plays 00's wife, as he's usually appearing in drag performing women's roles in Helge's Movies.So all you folks out there looking for new laughs, I strongly recommend this movie.
training	Andre Telefair	Andre Telefair	A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course learns that is not who she really is.
training	Andorra	Andorra	Iberia simply is the peninsula comprising Spain, Portugal, Andorra and Gibraltar; the very concept is more diluted.
training	Anderson	Anderson	The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: Anderson, Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts, with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee's merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri, Viveca Lindfors as Theirry's wise, perceptive mother Tatta, Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack, and Steve Buscemi as a funny, blithely shameless thief.
training	Amy Irving	Amy Irving	Amy Irving was put in this film to try and get a part of the Halloween H20 audience.
training	Amy Heckerling	Amy Heckerling	Amy Heckerling has a flair for directing comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking) but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton breezes through the role of Johnny, easily his best screen performance. Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin, what a shame directors didn't pick up on this
training	Amuro Ray	Amuro Ray	Their target, a new Gundam being built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) inside.
training	Amitabh	Amitabh	I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.

training	America	America	This was what black society was like before the crack epidemics, gangsta rap, and AIDS that beset the ghettos in the eighties. Decent, hardworking families that struggled to get by and all the traumas and tribulations they faced. Black America was a different group of people in the seventies. Still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movements of the sixties, times were hard but still worth fighting for. Keepin' your head above water, making a wave when you can, this show showed how black society struggled to work together as people and families, before they started to prey on each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the ghettos. It is heart-breaking to see what the black ghettos were like then and what they have become now.
training	Amelie	Amelie	It is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created Amelie a couple of years ago
training	Amanda Redman	Amanda Redman	While Amanda Redman has to face the all-too-familiar conflict between having a life and a career.
training	Amanda Farrell	Amanda Farrell	Then there's Amanda Farrell who did succeed professionally, but whose personal life has been sacrificed for an office with her name on the door
training	Amanda Burton	Amanda Burton	The acting is superb especially Amanda Burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...She does an amazing job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama.
training	Alyssa Milano	Alyssa Milano	"Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages. The movie focuses around ""Fizzy"" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This tv film was just great. The acting is #1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. 10/10"

training	Allan	Allan	Allan was very good and I thought the cinematography was amazing.
training	Alistair Cooke	Alistair Cooke	It expands their critical thinking.Impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war.Buy it for your children, along with Alistair Cooke's America.
training	Alison Elliott	Alison Elliott	"The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable. Basic elements such as character development were glossed over, at best. Inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads. A massive mansion in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Characters just ""showing up"" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, I might add)? All in all it wasn't ""bad"". I rated it a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott."

training	Alice Walkers	Alice Walkers	Steven Speilberg's adaptation of Alice Walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy.
training	Alice Walker	Alice Walker	While it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the African story, both of which were so vivid in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, allowing the voice of Alice Walker to shine through.
training	Alice Cespi	Alice Cespi	The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days.
training	Alice	Alice	The only one I felt for to some degree was Alice, you could literally feel the stress she's under for having to negotiate between the writer and the network guys, always pretending it's not all that bad and everything is hunkydory.
training	Alice	Alice	After the success of Part 4, another sequel was a natural move. However they should have stopped it before it began. Alice, having survived Part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems Freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims, which of course are Alice's friends. Strange Nightmare movie, very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the movie itself is not.
training	Alice	Alice	A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The dream child was the worst without a doubt, I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels. But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridicules and I wasn't happy with where it went. Alice just became more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her carrying this film on her own didn't work for me. Freddy is also loosing his scare, this was just getting a bit silly.

training	Alfred Molina	Alfred Molina	I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen.
training	Alfred Molina	Alfred Molina	After some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie, i was doubtful of giving it a go, but i had £3.99 in my wallet & thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie & saw this and gave it ago & I'm glad i did, i enjoyed it. Directed by The star of films such as Chain Reaction, the Ring, Bourne Identity,(Brian Cox) i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it weren't at all, i found some of the humour quite funny especially Alfred Molina the star of Spider-man 2 the Character Doc Ock. He was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film. Of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw Matthew's name, and that made me get it! and no his part isn't big at all, it's very short at the very end of the film, it's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film. I suggest you give it a go. Some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing, the acting, and a bit more action. But it's watchable.

training	Alex	Alex	Everything Is Illuminated presents a point of view rarely treated before Alex's point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war, who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact, who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people and maybe his own family as well were capable of.

training	Alberto Tomba	Alberto Tomba	I've recently watched this movie, in a lazy Sunday afternoon, with some friend of mine and we have a lot of fun! This movie is a masterpiece of trash. Try to watch it with this purpose! It hadn't been expected, of course, but the performance provided by the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the weak script and the low-cost budget had created an amazing mix of foolish things
training	Albert Pyun	Albert Pyun	Albert Pyun delivers a very good action/drama about a junkie who tries to rip-off a big crime-lord. A lot of style and many very cool actors. Burt Reynold is excellent.

training	Alan Squier	Alan Squier	First there is ██████████ , a disillusioned writer and intellectual who realizes he is a member of a vanishing breed of men whose visions of a Utopian existence have given way to the oppressive realities of a world that no longer has any room for his type of dreamer.
training	Alan Root	Alan Root	The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is truly classic footage.Alan Root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the Best Documentary Oscar.

training	Alan Rickman	Alan Rickman	Still, Alan Rickman should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance, no doubt about it.
training	Alan Jeffries	Alan Jeffries	as she convinces him to seek additional help and advice from Professor Alan Jeffries
training	Alan	Alan	The Alan/Ann story, the supposed original focus of the film has a tacked on quality about it.
training	Alan	Alan	*SOILER* It's fake! The whole thing is a fake! There is no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself. So he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala SCOOBY-DOO to drive Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them. He's not even killing them. He drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace. If he looked at the so-called ghost of Evelyn, he could tell she was wearing gloves! My God what a waste of time. Don't bother watching it, renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE. I give this stinker the CRAP-O-LANTERN.
training	Alain Delon	Alain Delon	This unhinged French production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars (if somewhat anti-heroes) Alain Delon and Charles Bronson.
training	Alain Delon	Alain Delon	For those seeking entertainment, watch the Alain Delon thrillers featured in the DVD extras.
training	Aladdin	Aladdin	I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cribbed from the film.
training	Al Sklar	Al Sklar	Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. This cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
training	Al Pacino	Al Pacino	In a role he was born to play, Al Pacino stars as New York's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy.
training	Al Pacino	Al Pacino	And of course you have Al Pacino in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film.
training	Al Pacino	Al Pacino	A lot of people are saying that Al Pacino over acted but I mean common obviously for a movie role like this -- a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent.

training	Aiden Quinn	Aiden Quinn	If you liked the Richard Chamberlain version of the Bourne Identity then you will like this too...Aiden Quinn does this one brilliantly, you can't help but wonder if he is really out there...I reckon he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it's so intense.

training	Aidan Quinn	Aidan Quinn	Okay so I love Aidan Quinn's acting even with a bad script.
training	Aidan Quinn	Aidan Quinn	I'm glad that Aidan Quinn got this opportunity to show another side of him (in fact two, because he plays the villain as well), even although the film wasn't that successful.Picture the scene: A bored student with an empty day ahead, A video shop with a special offer of 5 video for a week rentals.

training	Adrian Brody	Adrian Brody	The film essentially consists of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody looking intense and not saying anything, killing people (off screen-most of the action happens off screen).

training	Abel Gance	Abel Gance	"Although Lang's version is more famous,Borzage's work is not devoid of interest ,far from it:its ""celestial"" sequences are even better. The metaphor of the train (perhaps borrowed from the ending of Abel Gance's ""la roue"" ) is eventually more convincing than the ""up above"" heavenly world.  Borzage's tenderness for his characters shows in Marie's character and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects (the ending of ""three comrades"" ). The amusement park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we are in Marie's poor house. I do not think that the sets are that much cheesy,they are stylized to a fault. The fair from a distance almost gives a sci-fi feel to the movie.  Borzage never forgets his social concerns: in the heavenly train going up,the Rich cannot stand to be mixed up with the riffraff but as ""chief magistrate"" tells :""here there's no more difference"" .  Not a major work for Borzage (neither is Lang's version),but to seek out if you are interested in the great director's career."
